Clean up steering documentation

## Summary of Steering Documentation Improvements done by another agent

I've successfully streamlined and aligned the steering documentation by making the following key improvements:

âœ… Consolidation & Redundancy Removal
Merged
current-components.md
into
current-state.md

Eliminated duplicate component information
Created single source of truth for current state
Removed redundant file entirely
Removed Duplicate Command Listings

Consolidated development commands in development.md
Referenced tech.md for complete command reference
Eliminated repetitive command documentation
âœ… Clear Current vs Future State Distinction
Added Clear Disclaimers to Future-Oriented Files

testing-best-practices.md: Marked as "FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE"
database-best-practices.md: Marked as "FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE"
api-best-practices.md: Marked as "FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE"
Made it clear these contain patterns for when features are implemented
Updated Documentation Status in
current-state.md

Clearly marked which docs reflect current implementation (âœ…)
Clearly marked which docs are future guides (ðŸ”„)
âœ… Streamlined Content
Simplified
ui-best-practices.md

Removed excessive accessibility section with unimplemented patterns
Focused on actual established patterns
Kept essential accessibility principles without theoretical examples
Removed Redundant Sections

Eliminated duplicate testing information from development.md
Removed redundant database operation commands
Streamlined file organization guidelines
âœ… Improved Accuracy
Aligned Documentation with Actual Implementation
Ensured all "currently implemented" claims match reality
Removed theoretical patterns presented as existing
Updated component descriptions to reflect actual file structure
Result: Cleaner, More Accurate Documentation
The steering documentation is now:

More accurate: Clearly distinguishes between implemented and planned features
Less redundant: Eliminated duplicate information across files
Better organized: Single sources of truth for different types of information
Easier to navigate: Clear markers for current vs future implementation guides
More maintainable: Follows the documentation evolution protocol of being reactive rather than predictive
