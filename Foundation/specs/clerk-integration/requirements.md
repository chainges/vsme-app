# Clerk Authentication Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the integration of Clerk as the primary authentication provider for VSME Guru, replacing the custom JWT-based authentication system. Clerk will provide secure, scalable user authentication with built-in UI components and comprehensive user management features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clerk Setup and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Clerk authentication so that I can provide secure, professional authentication without building custom auth infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Clerk SHALL be properly configured with environment variables
2. WHEN a user visits the application THEN Clerk SHALL provide authentication state management
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN Clerk SHALL handle all security aspects including token management
4. IF Clerk configuration is missing THEN the application SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2: Frontend Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in and sign out seamlessly so that I can access protected features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks sign in THEN Clerk SHALL display the sign-in modal or redirect to sign-in page
2. WHEN a user completes sign-in THEN they SHALL be redirected to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user clicks sign out THEN they SHALL be logged out and redirected to the marketing page
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN their profile information SHALL be accessible throughout the app
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the UI SHALL update accordingly without page refresh

### Requirement 3: Protected Route System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to protect dashboard routes so that only authenticated users can access them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access /dashboard THEN they SHALL be redirected to sign-in
2. WHEN an authenticated user accesses /dashboard THEN they SHALL see the dashboard content
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN they SHALL be automatically redirected to sign-in
4. WHEN route protection is applied THEN it SHALL work consistently across all protected pages

### Requirement 4: Backend API Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify user authentication on the backend so that API endpoints are secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a frontend request includes Clerk session token THEN the backend SHALL verify it with Clerk
2. WHEN an API endpoint requires authentication THEN it SHALL validate the Clerk session
3. WHEN a user makes an authenticated request THEN their Clerk user ID SHALL be available to the API
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the API SHALL return appropriate 401 responses

### Requirement 5: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information so that I can keep my account details up to date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on their profile THEN they SHALL see Clerk's user profile component
2. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN changes SHALL be saved to Clerk automatically
3. WHEN a user views their profile THEN they SHALL see their current name, email, and avatar
4. WHEN profile changes are made THEN the UI SHALL reflect updates immediately

### Requirement 6: Database User Synchronization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to sync Clerk users with the local database so that I can associate users with application-specific data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up through Clerk THEN their basic info SHALL be synced to the local database
2. WHEN a user updates their Clerk profile THEN the local database SHALL be updated via webhooks
3. WHEN a user is deleted from Clerk THEN their local database record SHALL be handled appropriately
4. WHEN user sync fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide fallback behavior
