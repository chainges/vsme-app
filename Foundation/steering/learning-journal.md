## 2025-01-08 - Documentation Evolution Insight

**Context**: Created comprehensive steering documents for a project in early stages.

**Discovery**: Premature documentation creates several problems:
- AI agents get confused about what actually exists
- Documentation becomes stale quickly if not based on real implementation
- Theoretical patterns may not match what we actually build
- Creates cognitive overhead for developers

**Impact**: Need to shift from predictive to reactive documentation approach.

**Action Items**:
- Focus documentation on current state
- Update docs after implementing features, not before
- Use real code examples from actual implementation
- Establish clear update protocols
