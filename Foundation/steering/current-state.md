# Current State Audit

*Last Updated: January 8, 2025*

## What Actually Exists Right Now

### Frontend (apps/web/)
- ✅ **Next.js 15.3.0** with App Router
- ✅ **React 19** functional components
- ✅ **TailwindCSS 4.1.11** for styling
- ✅ **Theme System** with dark/light mode toggle
- ✅ **Basic Layout** with header and main content area
- ✅ **shadcn/ui Configuration** (components.json setup)
- ✅ **Font Setup** with Geist Sans and Geist Mono

#### Actual Components
- `layout.tsx`: Root layout with providers and header
- `page.tsx`: Home page with ASCII art title
- `header.tsx`: Navigation with theme toggle
- `providers.tsx`: Theme and toast providers
- `mode-toggle.tsx`: Dark/light theme switcher (referenced but not visible in files)
- `theme-provider.tsx`: Next-themes wrapper (referenced but not visible in files)

#### Dependencies Installed
- TanStack Query & Form (installed but not used yet)
- Sonner for toasts (configured but not used yet)
- Lucide React for icons
- Class Variance Authority and clsx for styling

### Backend (apps/server/)
- ✅ **Hono 4.8.10** web framework
- ✅ **Basic Server Setup** with CORS and logging
- ✅ **Single Route**: GET / returns "OK"
- ✅ **Prisma 6.13.0** configured for MongoDB
- ✅ **Empty Database Schema** (no models defined)

#### Actual Server Code
```typescript
// Only route that exists
app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.text("OK");
});
```

### Database
- ✅ **Prisma Configuration** for MongoDB with ESM
- ❌ **No Models Defined** (schema is empty)
- ❌ **No Database Connection** established yet
- ❌ **No Migrations** created

### Build System
- ✅ **Turborepo** for monorepo orchestration
- ✅ **Bun** as runtime and package manager
- ✅ **TypeScript** configuration
- ✅ **Biome + Ultracite** for code quality

## What Doesn't Exist Yet

### Database Layer
- No database models
- No database connection established
- No API routes beyond basic health check
- No data validation schemas

### API Layer
- No routers beyond basic setup
- No authentication
- No error handling patterns
- No request validation

### Frontend Features
- No data fetching implemented
- No forms implemented
- No complex UI components
- No state management beyond theme

### Testing
- No test setup
- No test files
- No testing configuration

## Environment Setup Status

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# apps/server/.env (needs to be created)
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://..."
CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3001"

# apps/web/.env (needs to be created)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### Development Commands That Work
```bash
bun dev          # Starts both apps
bun dev:web      # Frontend only
bun dev:server   # Backend only
bun check        # Code formatting/linting
```

### Commands That Need Setup
```bash
bun db:push      # Needs DATABASE_URL
bun db:studio    # Needs DATABASE_URL
bun db:generate  # Needs models in schema
```

## Next Logical Steps

Based on current state, the next steps would be:

1. **Environment Setup**: Create .env files with database connection
2. **First Database Model**: Add a simple model to Prisma schema
3. **First API Route**: Create a basic CRUD endpoint
4. **First UI Component**: Build a component that uses the API
5. **Connect Frontend to Backend**: Implement data fetching

## Documentation Accuracy Check

- ✅ tech.md: Accurately lists installed technologies
- ✅ structure.md: Matches actual file structure
- ⚠️ product.md: Overstates current capabilities
- ❌ api-patterns.md: Documents patterns that don't exist yet
- ❌ database-patterns.md: Documents models that don't exist yet
- ❌ ui-patterns.md: Documents components that don't exist yet
- ❌ testing-guide.md: Documents testing setup that doesn't exist yet

## Reality vs Documentation Gap

The steering documents currently describe a much more mature application than what actually exists. This creates confusion for AI agents who might try to use patterns or components that haven't been implemented yet.
