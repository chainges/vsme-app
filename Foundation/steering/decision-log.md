## 2025-01-08 - Database Architecture Design

**Context**: Needed to design database architecture for ESG reporting application with requirements for both internal data and external data sharing within the same Clerk domain.

**Options Considered**:
1. Single database with all data - simple but limits cross-application sharing
2. Dual database architecture (primary + external) - more complex but enables sharing
3. Microservices with separate databases - maximum flexibility but high complexity

**Decision**: Implement dual database architecture with primary MongoDB Atlas for application data and external MongoDB Atlas for shared data.

**Consequences**:
- Enables cross-application data sharing within Clerk domain
- Requires separate connection management and service layers
- Provides data isolation while enabling collaboration
- Supports read-only external access for security

## 2025-01-08 - ESG Data Structure Design

**Context**: Needed to design data structure for complex ESG reporting with Environmental, Social, and Governance data that matches industry standards.

**Options Considered**:
1. Flat structure with separate tables - normalized but complex queries
2. Nested objects in MongoDB - matches ESG standards but complex validation
3. JSON fields in relational database - flexible but loses type safety

**Decision**: Use nested objects in MongoDB with TypeScript types and Zod validation.

**Consequences**:
- Accurately represents ESG reporting standards (Environmental, Social, Governance)
- Maintains type safety with TypeScript and runtime validation
- Enables flexible reporting structures for different ESG frameworks
- Requires complex validation schemas but provides data integrity

**Status**: Active

## 2025-01-08 - Service Layer Architecture

**Context**: Needed to organize business logic and database operations for maintainability and testability with complex ESG data operations.

**Options Considered**:
1. Direct database calls in API routes - simple but hard to test and maintain
2. Service classes with dependency injection - more structure but better organization
3. Functional approach with utility modules - flexible but less structured

**Decision**: Implement service classes (CompanyService, ReportService, ExternalDataService) with dependency injection.

**Consequences**:
- Clear separation of business logic from API routes
- Enables comprehensive testing of business logic
- Provides consistent patterns for data operations
- Requires more files but improves maintainability and code organization

**Status**: Active

## 2025-01-08 - External Database Integration Strategy

**Context**: Required access to external databases for shared resources and reference data from other applications in the same Clerk domain.

**Options Considered**:
1. Direct MongoDB connections in API routes - simple but no connection management
2. Shared database client with connection pooling - better performance and resource management
3. External API calls to other applications - decoupled but adds network overhead

**Decision**: Implement dedicated external database client with connection pooling, timeout management, and health monitoring.

**Consequences**:
- Efficient resource utilization with connection pooling
- Robust error handling and graceful degradation
- Read-only access ensures data security
- Enables real-time access to shared resources without API overhead

## 2025-01-08 - Environment-Based Database Configuration

**Context**: Discovered hardcoded database names in external database client, needed to support different database names for different deployment environments (dev, test, staging, production).

**Options Considered**:
1. Keep hardcoded database names - simple but inflexible for deployments
2. Environment variables only - flexible but no validation or defaults
3. Comprehensive environment configuration system - more complex but robust

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive environment configuration system with automatic database name resolution, validation, and setup tools.

**Consequences**:
- Supports multiple deployment environments with appropriate database names
- Automatic database name selection based on NODE_ENV with override capability
- Environment validation prevents configuration errors
- Setup scripts provide guidance for different environments
- Centralized configuration management for consistency

## 2025-01-08 - Code Quality Tool Clarification

**Context**: Discovered unnecessary eslint-disable comments throughout the codebase, despite using Biome (via Ultracite) for linting and formatting, not ESLint.

**Options Considered**:
1. Leave eslint-disable comments - no impact but confusing for developers
2. Manual cleanup - time-consuming and error-prone
3. Automated cleanup script - efficient and thorough

**Decision**: Create and run automated cleanup script to remove all eslint-disable comments and clarify that we use Biome.

**Consequences**:
- Removed 174 unnecessary eslint-disable comments from 15 files
- Clarified in documentation that we use Biome, not ESLint
- Future developers will use correct `// biome-ignore` syntax
- Cleaner, more accurate codebase

**Status**: Active---


## 2025-01-08 - Type Alignment Validation System

**Context**: Need to maintain type safety across three layers (Prisma models, TypeScript interfaces, Zod schemas) as the ESG data structures evolve, with manual updates required for business types and validation schemas.

**Options Considered**:
1. Manual validation only - simple but error-prone and easy to forget
2. Build-time type checking - catches some issues but not runtime validation alignment
3. Automated validation script with Kiro hooks - comprehensive and automatic

**Decision**: Implement automated type alignment validation system with Kiro hooks that run on schema changes and Prisma operations.

**Consequences**:
- Automatic validation when schema files are modified
- Comprehensive checking of type alignment across all layers
- Early detection of type mismatches before they cause runtime errors
- Clear guidance on which files need updates when validation fails
- Integration with development workflow through Kiro hooks

## 2025-01-08 - Type Validation Strategy: Static vs Dynamic

**Context**: Created both static and dynamic type validation scripts to ensure alignment between TypeScript types, Zod schemas, and Prisma models.

**Options Considered**:
1. Static validation with manually crafted test data - reliable but requires maintenance
2. Dynamic validation with auto-discovery and generic test data - comprehensive but prone to false positives
3. Hybrid approach combining both strategies

**Decision**: Use static validation script (`validate-type-alignment.ts`) as the primary validation tool.

**Consequences**: 
- More reliable validation results with realistic test data
- Focused on core business types (Company, Report, ESG data)
- Requires manual updates when new types are added
- Provides meaningful validation errors that indicate real issues
- Integrates well with Kiro hooks for automated validation
