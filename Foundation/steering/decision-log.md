# Architectural Decision Log

*Format: Each decision includes context, options considered, decision made, and reasoning*

## Decision Template

```markdown
## [Date] - [Decision Title]

**Context**: What situation led to this decision?

**Options Considered**:
1. Option A - pros/cons
2. Option B - pros/cons
3. Option C - pros/cons

**Decision**: What we chose and why

**Consequences**: What this means for future development

**Status**: Active | Superseded | Deprecated

## 2025-01-08 - Documentation Strategy

**Context**: Initial project setup had comprehensive documentation for features that don't exist yet, creating confusion about what's actually implemented.

**Options Considered**:
1. Keep comprehensive upfront documentation - provides complete guidance but may not match reality
2. Minimal documentation that grows with implementation - more accurate but less guidance initially
3. Hybrid approach with clear current state vs future patterns - balances accuracy with guidance

**Decision**: Implement reactive documentation that evolves with the codebase, focusing on current state accuracy.

**Consequences**: 
- Documentation will be more accurate but initially less comprehensive
- Need to establish update protocols for when features are implemented
- AI agents will have better context about what actually exists

**Status**: Active

## 2025-01-08 - Technology Stack Selection

**Context**: Project was initialized with Better-T-Stack template providing opinionated technology choices.

**Options Considered**:
1. Accept all template choices as-is
2. Evaluate and potentially replace some technologies
3. Document rationale for keeping current stack

**Decision**: Keep current stack (Next.js 15, React 19, Hono, Prisma, MongoDB, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui) as it provides a solid foundation.

**Consequences**:
- Consistent with template design decisions
- Well-integrated toolchain
- Good performance characteristics with Bun runtime
- Modern React patterns with latest features

**Status**: Active

## Future Decisions

*This section will be populated as we make architectural decisions during development*

### Pending Decisions
- Database schema design approach
- Authentication strategy
- API structure and routing patterns
- State management patterns
- Testing strategy implementation

### Decision Criteria

When making architectural decisions, consider:
1. **Alignment with current stack**: Does it work well with our chosen technologies?
2. **Developer experience**: Does it improve or hinder development workflow?
3. **Performance impact**: What are the performance implications?
4. **Maintainability**: How does this affect long-term maintenance?
5. **Team knowledge**: Do we have expertise with this approach?
6. **Community support**: Is there good documentation and community around this choice?
