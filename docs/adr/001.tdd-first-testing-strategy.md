# ADR 001: TDD-First Testing Strategy Implementation

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-26  
**Epic**: Epic 10 - Testing Strategy  
**Decision Makers**: Quinn (QA Lead), BMAD Team  

## Context

### Problem Statement

The My Better T App project lacked a comprehensive testing strategy and standardized development methodology. Developers were implementing features without consistent testing patterns, leading to:

- **Ad-hoc testing practices**: Tests written after implementation (if at all)
- **Inconsistent quality standards**: No unified approach to test coverage or methodology
- **Slow developer onboarding**: New team members had no clear guidance on testing practices
- **Technical debt accumulation**: Untested code making refactoring risky
- **Accessibility gaps**: No systematic approach to testing accessibility compliance

### Constraints and Forces

- **Existing codebase**: Must integrate with current Next.js 15.3.0 + TypeScript strict mode setup
- **Development velocity**: Cannot significantly slow down current feature development
- **Team skill levels**: Mixed experience with TDD methodology across team members
- **Tool ecosystem**: Must work with existing Turbo monorepo structure
- **Documentation requirements**: BMAD principles demand simple, correct, lean, and actionable documentation

## Decision

**We have implemented a comprehensive TDD-first testing strategy** that establishes Test-Driven Development as the standard methodology for all new feature development, supported by a complete documentation ecosystem and testing infrastructure.

### Technical Approach

**Core Methodology**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD cycle becomes mandatory for P0 functionality and recommended for P1 features.

**Documentation Hierarchy**: 
1. **Coding Standards Integration** → Discovers TDD requirement
2. **TDD Process Guide** → Learns methodology
3. **Testing Pattern Library** → Implements with copy-paste templates  
4. **Testing Quick Start Guide** → Rapid onboarding reference

**Infrastructure Stack**: Vitest 3.2.4 + React Testing Library 16.3.0 + jsdom 26.1.0 with comprehensive mocking

### Key Components

```

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

✅ **Systematic TDD Adoption**: Clear pathway from coding standards to practical implementation  
✅ **Developer Productivity**: 15-minute onboarding to first test with copy-paste patterns  
✅ **Quality Consistency**: Standardized approach across all development scenarios  
✅ **Accessibility Integration**: Testing patterns prioritize screen reader compatibility  
✅ **Technical Debt Prevention**: TDD methodology prevents untested code accumulation  
✅ **Safe Refactoring**: Test safety nets enable confident code improvements  
✅ **Documentation Cohesion**: Seamless integration with existing BMAD documentation structure  

### Negative Outcomes

⚠️ **Initial Learning Curve**: Team members unfamiliar with TDD will need training period  
⚠️ **Development Rhythm Change**: Short-term adjustment period as developers adapt to test-first approach  
⚠️ **Code Volume Increase**: Test code will equal or exceed implementation code  

### Risks

🚨 **TDD Discipline Erosion**: Risk of reverting to old practices under pressure  
🚨 **Pattern Maintenance Overhead**: Testing patterns must be kept current with evolving codebase  
🚨 **Tool Dependency**: Heavy reliance on Vitest ecosystem for development workflow  

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.6.4",
    "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0", 
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.6.1",
    "jsdom": "^26.1.0",
    "vitest": "^3.2.4"
  }
}
```

### Configuration

**Vitest Configuration** (`apps/web/vitest.config.mjs`):
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./src/test-setup.ts'],
    globals: true,
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: { '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src') }
  }
})
```

**Comprehensive Test Setup** (`apps/web/src/test-setup.ts`):
- ✅ Global React + JSX automatic configuration
- ✅ Framer Motion mocking for animation components  
- ✅ localStorage/navigator mocking for browser APIs
- ✅ ResizeObserver/IntersectionObserver mocking for Radix UI
- ✅ DOM interaction mocking (getBoundingClientRect, scrollIntoView)

### Performance Characteristics

**Test Execution Targets**:
- Unit tests: <10 seconds total execution
- Integration tests: <30 seconds total execution  
- TDD cycle: <30 seconds RED→GREEN feedback
- Single test file: <2 seconds execution

**Quality Thresholds**:
- Unit test coverage: ≥80% for core functionality
- Integration test coverage: ≥60% for user workflows
- P0 functionality: 100% TDD methodology compliance

**Immediate Validation (Completed)**:
- ✅ New developer can write first test in 15 minutes using Quick Start Guide
- ✅ TDD process documentation is actionable with real examples
- ✅ Pattern library provides copy-paste templates for all major scenarios  
- ✅ Documentation discovery flow is intuitive and well-linked
- ✅ All testing examples work without modification in current environment

**Ongoing Validation Metrics**:
- **TDD Adoption Rate**: Track % of new features developed with test-first approach
- **Developer Onboarding Time**: Measure time from joining team to productive testing
- **Test Coverage Trends**: Monitor unit/integration coverage across sprints
- **Refactoring Confidence**: Track frequency and success rate of code improvements
