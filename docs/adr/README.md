## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project, along with their context and consequences. They help team members understand why certain architectural choices were made and provide guidance for future development decisions.

Each ADR follows a consistent structure:
- **Context**: The issue or opportunity that motivated the decision
- **Decision**: The architectural decision and approach taken
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision
- **Implementation Details**: Technical specifics and configuration
- **Validation**: Success metrics and review criteria

## Creating New ADRs

New ADRs should be created when making architecturally significant decisions such as:
- Adopting new frameworks or major libraries
- Changing development methodologies or workflows  
- Implementing new infrastructure or deployment approaches
- Making decisions that affect multiple components or teams
- Establishing new coding standards or quality practices

Use the next sequential number and follow the established template structure for consistency.
