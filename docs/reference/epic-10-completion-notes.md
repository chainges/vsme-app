    ├── api/                    # API testing patterns
    └── integration/            # System integration patterns
```

### **Knowledge Flow Design**
1. **Developer reads Coding Standards** → Discovers TDD requirement
2. **Follows TDD Process Guide** → Learns RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
3. **Uses Testing Patterns** → Copy-paste implementations
4. **Quick Start when needed** → Fast setup reference

## 🎖️ **Quality Standards Achieved**

### **Comprehensive Coverage**
- ✅ **Process documentation** - Complete TDD methodology
- ✅ **Practical patterns** - 20+ ready-to-use examples
- ✅ **Quick onboarding** - 15-minute setup guide
- ✅ **Standards integration** - TDD embedded in coding standards
- ✅ **Tool configuration** - Vitest, RTL, MSW setup complete

### **TDD Adoption Framework**
- ✅ **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR** cycle documentation
- ✅ **Test-first development** principles
- ✅ **Accessibility-focused** testing approach
- ✅ **Git workflow** integration
- ✅ **Pattern-based** learning approach

## 📝 **Notes for Doc Brown Review**

### **🔍 Documentation Consistency Review Needed**

**Priority Areas for Review:**

1. **Cross-Reference Validation**
   - Verify all internal links work correctly
   - Check that file paths in coding standards match actual structure
   - Ensure pattern examples reference consistent project structure

2. **Terminology Consistency**
   - Standardize testing terminology across all documents
   - Verify consistent tool naming (Vitest vs. vitest, React Testing Library vs. RTL)
   - Check that TDD terminology is used consistently

3. **Content Depth Balance**
   - Review if Quick Start Guide maintains "15-minute" promise
   - Assess if TDD Process Guide provides sufficient detail without overwhelming
   - Validate that patterns are truly "copy-paste ready"

4. **Integration Points**
   - Verify smooth flow between documents
   - Check that coding standards effectively guide to testing resources
   - Assess if pattern library categories make intuitive sense

### **🎯 Specific Review Requests**

1. **Accessibility Standards Alignment**
   - Ensure testing patterns align with a11y requirements in coding standards
   - Verify consistent use of accessibility-focused queries

2. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Check that all testing examples follow TypeScript strict mode
   - Validate type safety in pattern examples

3. **Project-Specific Customization**
   - Review if examples need adjustment for My Better T App specifics
   - Assess if any Turbo/monorepo considerations are missing

### **🚨 Potential Issues to Investigate**

1. **File Path Consistency** - Some patterns reference `/src/` but project uses `/apps/web/src/`
2. **Tool Version Alignment** - Verify all tool versions match current project setup
3. **Example Code Currency** - Ensure all code examples work with current dependencies

### **📊 Success Metrics for Review**

- [ ] New developer can write first test in 15 minutes using guides
- [ ] TDD process is clear and actionable
- [ ] Patterns solve real testing scenarios developers encounter
- [ ] Documentation discovery flow is intuitive
- [ ] All examples work without modification
