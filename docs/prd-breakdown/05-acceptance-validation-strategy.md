# VSME Guru PRD - Acceptance & Validation Strategy

**Source:** PRD Section 5  
**Version:** 4.0  
**Date:** August 19, 2025

## Acceptance Criteria Strategy

### User Story Translation
Every functional requirement (FR) listed in this document will be translated into detailed user stories with specific, testable acceptance criteria before development begins.

### BDD Format Preference
**Preferred Format:** BDD with GIVEN -> WHEN -> THEN structure
- **GIVEN:** Preconditions and context
- **WHEN:** Action or event that occurs
- **THEN:** Expected outcomes and results

### Example BDD Format
```gherkin
Feature: Company Profile Creation
  Scenario: New user creates company profile via API search
    Given a new user has completed authentication
    And the user is on the onboarding page
    When the user searches for their company via brreg.no API
    And selects the correct company from search results
    Then a company profile should be created in the database
    And the user should be redirected to the dashboard
    And the company information should be pre-populated
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process
**Process:** Write tests first, then implement the feature
- **Step 1:** Write failing test for requirement
- **Step 2:** Implement minimal code to pass test
- **Step 3:** Refactor code while maintaining test coverage
- **Step 4:** Repeat for next requirement

### Unit Testing
**Scope:** All calculations and business logic
- **Coverage:** Minimum 90% code coverage
- **Focus:** Individual functions and methods
- **Framework:** Project-specific testing framework
- **Examples:**
  - GHG intensity calculations
  - Gender pay gap calculations
  - Data validation logic
  - Business rule enforcement

### Integration Testing
**Scope:** API and database interactions
- **Database Testing:** MongoDB operations and data integrity
- **API Testing:** External API integrations (brreg.no)
- **Authentication Testing:** Clerk integration flows
- **Data Flow Testing:** End-to-end data processing

### End-to-End Testing
**Scope:** Critical user workflows
- **Onboarding Paths:** New user registration and company setup
- **Report Generation:** Complete report creation process
- **Data Entry:** Module completion workflows
- **User Experience:** Navigation and interface interactions

### Test Categories

#### Functional Testing
- **Requirements Validation:** Verify all FRs are met
- **User Workflows:** Test complete user journeys
- **Data Validation:** Ensure data integrity and accuracy
- **Business Logic:** Verify calculations and rules

#### Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance Testing:** Load times, PDF generation speed
- **Security Testing:** Authentication, data protection
- **Accessibility Testing:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- **Usability Testing:** User experience and interface design

#### Cross-Browser Testing
- **Browser Compatibility:** Major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Device Testing:** Desktop, tablet, mobile responsiveness
- **Accessibility Tools:** Screen reader compatibility

## User Feedback Loop

### Beta Testing Phase
**Timing:** Before public launch
**Participants:** Select group of SMEs
**Purpose:** Gather feedback and validate usability

### Success Metrics
**Usability:** User can complete tasks without assistance
**Time-Saving:** Significant reduction in reporting time
**User Satisfaction:** High satisfaction scores
**Error Rates:** Low error rates in user workflows

### Feedback Collection Methods
- **User Interviews:** One-on-one feedback sessions
- **Usability Testing:** Observed user interactions
- **Surveys:** Structured feedback collection
- **Analytics:** User behavior tracking
- **Support Tickets:** Issue identification and resolution

### Feedback Integration
- **Prioritization:** Rank feedback by impact and effort
- **Implementation:** Incorporate feedback into development
- **Validation:** Verify feedback implementation
- **Communication:** Update users on changes made

## Quality Assurance Process

### Code Review
**Requirement:** All code changes reviewed before merge
**Focus:** Code quality, security, performance
**Standards:** Project coding standards and best practices

### Automated Testing
**CI/CD Integration:** Tests run on every code change
**Quality Gates:** Code coverage and test passing requirements
**Automated Deployment:** Automated testing in deployment pipeline

### Manual Testing
**User Acceptance Testing:** Stakeholder validation of features
**Exploratory Testing:** Unscripted testing by QA team
**Regression Testing:** Verify existing functionality remains intact

### Performance Validation
**Load Testing:** System performance under expected load
**Stress Testing:** System behavior under extreme conditions
**Monitoring:** Real-time performance metrics tracking

## Compliance Validation

### GDPR Compliance
**Legal Review:** Legal team validation of data handling
**Privacy Impact Assessment:** Document data processing activities
**User Consent:** Verify consent mechanisms and records
**Data Rights:** Test user data access and deletion capabilities

### VSME Standard Compliance
**Expert Review:** Sustainability reporting expert validation
**Standard Mapping:** Verify requirements align with VSME standard
**Report Validation:** Ensure generated reports meet standard requirements

### Accessibility Compliance
**WCAG 2.1 Level AA:** Automated and manual accessibility testing
**Third-Party Audit:** Independent accessibility compliance verification
**User Testing:** Testing with users with disabilities
