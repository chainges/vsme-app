# Data Fetching Strategy Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive data fetching strategy for the application, including integration with both the primary MongoDB Atlas database and an external MongoDB Atlas database. The strategy encompasses TanStack Query configuration, API development, caching mechanisms, and robust error handling to provide a seamless data management experience across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Primary Database Configuration and Connection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a connection to the primary MongoDB Atlas database so that I can store and retrieve application-specific data with type safety and proper error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the primary MongoDB Atlas connection SHALL be established using Prisma
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the configured Prisma client with proper error handling
3. WHEN the database schema changes THEN migrations SHALL be applied automatically in development
4. IF the database connection fails THEN the application SHALL log appropriate errors and provide fallback behavior

### Requirement 2: External Database Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to an external MongoDB Atlas database so that I can fetch shared data from another application in the same Clerk domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external data is requested THEN the application SHALL connect to the external MongoDB Atlas database
2. WHEN external database queries are made THEN they SHALL be read-only operations with proper authentication
3. WHEN external data is fetched THEN it SHALL be validated using runtime type checking
4. IF external database access fails THEN the application SHALL handle errors gracefully without affecting primary functionality

### Requirement 3: TanStack Query Configuration and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure TanStack Query for server state management so that I can provide efficient data fetching with caching, background updates, and optimistic UI updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN TanStack Query SHALL be configured with appropriate default settings
2. WHEN data is fetched THEN it SHALL be cached according to defined cache strategies
3. WHEN data becomes stale THEN it SHALL be refetched in the background automatically
4. WHEN development mode is active THEN React Query DevTools SHALL be available for debugging

### Requirement 4: API Layer Development

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create robust API endpoints so that the frontend can perform CRUD operations on the primary database and read operations on the external database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL validate request data using Zod schemas
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and logging
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN API endpoints SHALL verify Clerk session tokens
4. WHEN API responses are sent THEN they SHALL follow consistent response format patterns

### Requirement 5: Frontend Data Fetching Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want data to load efficiently with clear loading states so that I can understand when information is being fetched and when errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is being fetched THEN loading indicators SHALL be displayed to the user
2. WHEN data fetching fails THEN error messages SHALL be shown with retry options
3. WHEN data is successfully loaded THEN it SHALL be displayed immediately without page refresh
4. WHEN user interactions trigger data changes THEN optimistic updates SHALL provide immediate feedback

### Requirement 6: Caching and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and work efficiently so that I can access information without unnecessary delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is fetched THEN it SHALL be cached to avoid redundant network requests
2. WHEN cached data becomes stale THEN it SHALL be updated in the background
3. WHEN pagination is needed THEN infinite scroll or pagination SHALL be implemented efficiently
4. WHEN data changes THEN related queries SHALL be invalidated and refetched appropriately

### Requirement 7: Authentication-Aware Data Fetching

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access only the data I'm authorized to see so that data security and privacy are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticated users request data THEN their Clerk user ID SHALL be used for authorization
2. WHEN unauthenticated users access the application THEN they SHALL only see public data
3. WHEN user sessions expire THEN data fetching SHALL handle authentication errors gracefully
4. WHEN user permissions change THEN data access SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully so that I can continue using the application even when some data is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the application SHALL retry requests with exponential backoff
2. WHEN server errors occur THEN user-friendly error messages SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN partial data loading fails THEN available data SHALL still be shown to the user
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN error boundaries SHALL prevent application crashes

### Requirement 9: Data Synchronization and Real-time Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see updated data automatically so that I always have the most current information available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes on the server THEN the frontend SHALL update automatically when possible
2. WHEN multiple users modify data THEN conflicts SHALL be handled appropriately
3. WHEN background sync occurs THEN it SHALL not interfere with user interactions
4. WHEN real-time updates are available THEN they SHALL be implemented for critical data

### Requirement 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for data fetching functionality so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are developed THEN they SHALL have unit tests covering success and error cases
2. WHEN custom hooks are created THEN they SHALL have tests verifying their behavior
3. WHEN data fetching flows are implemented THEN integration tests SHALL verify end-to-end functionality
4. WHEN performance requirements exist THEN load testing SHALL validate system capacity
