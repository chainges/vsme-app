# Multistep Form System - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement a comprehensive, reusable multi-step form system using TanStack Forms and Zod validation to replace the existing React Hook Form implementation and provide a flexible, type-safe solution for sustainability reporting forms.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: VSME Guru sustainability reporting platform with basic UI foundation, mock authentication, and existing form patterns
- Technology stack: Next.js 15.3.0, React 19, TailwindCSS 4.1.11, shadcn/ui components, Hono backend, Prisma database
- Integration points: GeneralInfo page, existing form components, authentication context, local storage system

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Complete multi-step form system with reusable architecture, sustainability form configuration, and enhanced user experience
- How it integrates: Leverages existing UI components, follows established patterns, integrates with mock authentication context, uses existing storage patterns
- Success criteria: Fully functional sustainability reporting form with data persistence, validation, accessibility, and responsive design

## Stories

Based on the implementation plan analysis, this epic requires 8 focused stories to complete the remaining work:

1. **Story 8:** âœ… MultiStepForm Controller Component - Core form orchestration and state management
2. **Story 9:** Step Renderer and Configuration System - Dynamic step rendering and form configuration
3. **Story 10:** GeneralInfo Page Integration - Complete form integration into existing page
4. **Story 11:** Validation and Error Handling - Comprehensive validation and user feedback
5. **Story 12:** Accessibility Enhancements - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and screen reader support
6. **Story 13:** Data Persistence Features - Local storage integration and data recovery
7. **Story 14:** Animations and Responsive Design - Smooth transitions and mobile optimization
8. **Story 15:** Comprehensive Testing Suite - Unit, integration, and accessibility testing

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (no backend changes required)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no database changes in this phase)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (leverages shadcn/ui and existing component structure)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (optimized form rendering and state management)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Complex form logic and state management could introduce bugs affecting existing functionality
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing strategy, incremental delivery, and rollback capability for each story
- **Rollback Plan:** Each story can be independently rolled back, with form system isolated from core application functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 8 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through comprehensive testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly with existing system
- [ ] Documentation updated for form system usage and configuration
- [ ] No regression in existing features or performance
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Responsive design verified across device sizes
- [ ] Local storage persistence working correctly

## Technical Architecture

**Core Components:**
- MultiStepForm: Main form controller with React Hook Form integration
- StepRenderer: Dynamic step rendering based on configuration
- Field Components: Reusable form fields with validation
- Storage Layer: Local storage provider with future MongoDB migration path

**Data Flow:**
1. Form configuration defines steps, fields, and validation
2. React Hook Form manages state and validation
3. Local storage provides persistence and recovery
4. UI components render form with accessibility features

**Integration Points:**
- GeneralInfo page: Primary implementation target
- Existing UI components: Leverages shadcn/ui patterns
- Authentication context: User-specific form data
- Storage system: Local storage with future database migration

## Success Metrics

- **Functionality:** All form steps render correctly with proper validation
- **Performance:** Form interactions respond within 100ms
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- **User Experience:** Smooth navigation between steps with clear progress indication
- **Data Integrity:** Form data persists correctly and restores on page reload
- **Responsiveness:** Form works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- react-hook-form: Form state management
- @hookform/resolvers: Zod resolver for form validation
- framer-motion: Smooth animations and transitions
- zod: Schema validation and type safety

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Existing UI component library (shadcn/ui)
- Mock authentication context
- Local storage utilities
- Existing form patterns and styling

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1 (Stories 8-10):** Core form system and basic integration
**Phase 2 (Stories 11-13):** Validation, accessibility, and data persistence
**Phase 3 (Stories 14-15):** Polish, testing, and performance optimization

## Notes

- This epic represents a significant enhancement but follows existing patterns and architecture
- Local storage will be used initially with clear migration path to MongoDB Atlas
- The form system is designed to be reusable for future form implementations
- All components follow established accessibility and TypeScript patterns
- Testing strategy includes automated accessibility testing with jest-axe
