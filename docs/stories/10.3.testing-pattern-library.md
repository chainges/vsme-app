# Story 10.3: Create Testing Pattern Library & Update Documentation

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer implementing tests across the project,  
**I want** a comprehensive testing pattern library with reusable templates and updated project documentation,  
**so that** I can consistently apply proper testing patterns and have all testing guidance unified across README, coding standards, and reference documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Extract and improve patterns**: Create reusable testing patterns based on proper TDD methodology (from Story 10.2), not just copying existing MultiStepForm examples
2. **Comprehensive pattern coverage**: Include patterns for API testing, hook testing, utility testing, and component testing following TDD principles
3. **Template creation**: Provide copy-paste templates for common test scenarios with TDD workflow integration
4. **README documentation update**: Enhance README.md testing section with clear guidance linking to new documentation
5. **Coding standards integration**: Update coding-standards.md TDD section with references to comprehensive testing documentation
6. **Cross-reference consistency**: Create clear cross-references between all testing documents ensuring unified guidance
7. **Integration examples**: Show patterns working with existing mocking setup (ResizeObserver, IntersectionObserver, MSW)

## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Context**
- **Story 10.1**: Created Testing Quick Start Guide for immediate productivity
- **Story 10.2**: Established comprehensive TDD process documentation with proper methodology
- **Story 10.3**: Completes the documentation trilogy by creating reusable patterns and unified documentation

### **Pattern Library Requirements** [Source: Epic context and testing strategy]
- **Beyond existing examples**: Patterns must be based on proper TDD methodology from Story 10.2, not just extracted from MultiStepForm.test.tsx
- **TDD-first patterns**: Each pattern should demonstrate test-first development approach
- **Reusable templates**: Patterns should be copy-paste ready with clear customization points
- **Integration focus**: Patterns must work with existing infrastructure and mocking setup

### **Current Testing Infrastructure Integration** [Source: test-setup.ts, vitest.config.mjs]
- **Test Runner**: Vitest 3.2.4 with watch mode, coverage reporting, and jsdom environment
- **Component Testing**: @testing-library/react (renderWithProviders utility needs to be created per design)
- **Mocking Setup**: ResizeObserver, IntersectionObserver, localStorage, DOM methods comprehensive mocking (implemented in test-setup.ts)
- **MSW Configuration**: Mock Service Worker setup for API endpoint mocking (planned per testing strategy design)
- **Path Aliases**: `@/` resolution for clean import patterns in tests

### **Testing Strategy Patterns** [Source: .kiro/specs/testing-strategy/design.md]
- **Test Utilities Setup**: Custom renderWithProviders with QueryClient and ThemeProvider (design documented, needs implementation)
- **MSW Handler Patterns**: API endpoint mocking with HttpResponse patterns (design documented, needs implementation)
- **Test Database Patterns**: Prisma test client setup with isolated test environments (design documented)
- **Component Testing Approach**: User interactions, state changes, accessibility validation
- **Integration Testing Approach**: API endpoints, database operations, authentication flows

### **BMAD Framework Integration** [Source: .bmad-core/data/]
- **Test Levels**: Patterns must align with unit/integration/E2E level decisions
- **Priority Matrix**: P0/P1/P2 patterns with appropriate coverage expectations
- **Test ID Format**: Maintain `{EPIC}.{STORY}-{LEVEL}-{SEQ}` format in pattern examples
- **Quality Gates**: Patterns must support coverage thresholds and performance targets

### **Documentation Architecture** [Source: Current documentation structure]
- **README.md**: Update testing section (lines 135-141) with comprehensive guidance
- **coding-standards.md**: Enhance TDD section (line 14) with pattern library references
- **test-levels-framework.md**: Add practical examples linking to patterns
- **Cross-references**: Create unified documentation navigation

### **Pattern Categories Required**
1. **Component Patterns**: TDD-first component development, provider testing, accessibility validation
2. **Utility Patterns**: Pure function TDD, validation schema testing, error handling
3. **Hook Patterns**: Custom hook TDD, state management testing, async hook patterns
4. **API Patterns**: MSW-based API testing, authentication patterns, error scenarios
5. **Integration Patterns**: Database testing, external service mocking, end-to-end workflows

### **File Locations** [Source: docs/architecture-breakdown/03-repository-structure.md]
- **Pattern Library**: `docs/reference/testing-patterns/` directory structure
- **Pattern Index**: `docs/reference/testing-patterns/index.md`
- **Individual Patterns**: Organized by type (component/, utility/, hook/, api/, integration/)
- **Updated Documentation**: README.md, coding-standards.md, test-levels-framework.md

### **Integration Points**
- **Story 10.1**: References quick start guide for onboarding flow
- **Story 10.2**: Uses TDD methodology as foundation for all patterns
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Works with current Vitest, @testing-library, mocking setup
- **BMAD Frameworks**: Integrates with test levels and priority matrix
- **Future Development**: Provides foundation for all future testing in project

### **Technical Constraints**
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Must work with current testing setup without breaking changes
- **BMAD Principles**: Maintain simplicity, correctness, and lean approach in patterns
- **Performance**: Patterns must support fast test execution and TDD workflow
- **Maintainability**: Patterns should reduce testing effort, not increase complexity

### **Testing Standards**
- **Pattern validation**: Each pattern must be tested with real implementation scenarios
- **TDD methodology**: Patterns must demonstrate proper test-first development
- **Infrastructure integration**: Verify patterns work with existing mocking and configuration
- **Documentation accuracy**: Ensure all cross-references and links are correct
- **Copy-paste readiness**: All templates must be syntactically correct and executable
- **Cross-reference validation**: All internal links and document references must be verified
- **Real-world applicability**: Patterns must solve actual testing scenarios developers encounter
