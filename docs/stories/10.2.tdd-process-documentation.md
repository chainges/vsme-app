# Story 10.2: Establish Comprehensive TDD Process Documentation

## Status
Review

## Story

**As a** developer following Test-Driven Development practices,  
**I want** comprehensive TDD process documentation with clear workflows, decision trees, and practical examples,  
**so that** I can confidently implement proper TDD methodology and make informed decisions about when and how to apply TDD across different development scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Clear TDD workflow integration**: Document RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle integrated with BMAD test levels (unit/integration/E2E)
2. **Decision tree for TDD application**: Provide clear guidance on when to use TDD vs other approaches for different scenarios (new features, bug fixes, refactoring)
3. **Comprehensive scenario examples**: Include TDD examples for components, utilities, API routes, and hooks - not just the existing MultiStepForm patterns
4. **Integration with existing infrastructure**: Demonstrate TDD workflow using current Vitest, @testing-library/react, and mocking setup
5. **Performance and quality gates**: Document coverage thresholds, test performance targets, and quality metrics aligned with project requirements
6. **BMAD framework alignment**: Show how TDD integrates with BMAD test priorities (P0/P1/P2) and test levels framework
7. **Beyond existing examples**: Establish proper TDD methodology that improves upon current ad-hoc testing approach

## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Context**
Story 10.1 created basic testing guidance. Story 10.2 establishes proper TDD methodology that addresses the fundamental gap: **current testing was implemented after-the-fact rather than following proper TDD practices**.

### **Current Testing Methodology Gap** [Analysis Required]
- **Existing approach**: MultiStepForm.test.tsx was written after implementation (531 lines of post-facto testing)
- **Missing TDD foundation**: No RED-GREEN-REFACTOR workflow documentation
- **Ad-hoc test organization**: Tests grouped by functionality rather than TDD development phases
- **Need for proper methodology**: Establish TDD as primary development approach going forward

### **TDD Best Practices** [Source: .kiro/specs/testing-strategy/requirements.md, design.md]
- **Requirement 6**: "Tests SHALL be written before implementation", "failing tests SHALL be written to reproduce issue before fixing"
- **TDD Cycle**: Developer → Write Test → Run Test (Fail) → Implement Code → Run Test (Pass) → Refactor → Repeat
- **Testing Pyramid**: Unit Tests (base) → Integration Tests → E2E Tests (top), with TDD primarily at unit level
- **Quality Gates**: 80% unit coverage minimum, code coverage drops below thresholds = build fails

### **Current Testing Infrastructure** [Source: Story 7.5, vitest.config.mjs]
- **Test Runner**: Vitest 3.2.4 with watch mode support for TDD rapid iteration
- **Component Testing**: @testing-library/react with renderWithProviders utility
- **Mocking Infrastructure**: Comprehensive browser API mocks, MSW for API endpoints
- **Coverage Reporting**: Text, JSON, HTML reporters with configurable thresholds
- **Commands**: `bun test` (watch mode perfect for TDD), `bun test:run` (CI), `bun test:ui` (debugging)

### **BMAD Test Frameworks Integration** [Source: .bmad-core/data/test-levels-framework.md, test-priorities-matrix.md]
- **Test Levels**: Unit (TDD primary), Integration (TDD secondary), E2E (TDD rare)
- **Priority Matrix**: P0 (TDD required), P1 (TDD recommended), P2 (TDD optional), P3 (manual acceptable)
- **TDD Application**: Favor unit tests for TDD (fast feedback), use integration for API contracts, reserve E2E for critical user journeys
- **Test ID Format**: Maintain `{EPIC}.{STORY}-{LEVEL}-{SEQ}` format within TDD workflow

### **Proper TDD Methodology** [Source: Testing strategy specifications]
- **RED Phase**: Write failing test first, run test to confirm failure, ensure test failure is for right reason
- **GREEN Phase**: Write minimal code to pass test, no additional functionality, focus on making test pass
- **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green, extract methods, improve readability
- **Iteration**: Repeat cycle for each small piece of functionality, commit at green phase

### **TDD Decision Factors** [Source: Testing strategy requirements]
- **Apply TDD when**: New feature development, complex business logic, API endpoint creation, bug reproduction
- **TDD optional when**: Simple CRUD operations, UI styling, configuration changes, third-party integrations
- **TDD workflow variations**: Feature TDD (outside-in), Unit TDD (inside-out), Bug-fix TDD (reproduce first)

### **File Locations** [Source: docs/architecture-breakdown/03-repository-structure.md]
- **TDD documentation**: `docs/reference/tdd-process-guide.md`
- **Test templates**: `docs/reference/test-templates/` directory
- **TDD examples**: Within documentation, referencing actual test files
- **IDE configuration**: Document VSCode/IDE snippets for TDD workflow

### **Integration Points**
- **Story 10.1**: Builds upon Testing Quick Start Guide foundation
- **Story 10.3**: Will provide pattern library based on proper TDD examples
- **BMAD frameworks**: Enhances existing test-levels-framework.md with TDD methodology
- **Development workflow**: Integrates with existing story development process

### **Technical Constraints**
- **Existing infrastructure**: Must work with current Vitest + @testing-library setup
- **BMAD principles**: Maintain simplicity, correctness, lean approach
- **Performance targets**: TDD workflow must not slow development velocity
- **Backward compatibility**: New TDD approach should coexist with existing tests

## Testing

### **Test File Location**
- No test file required - this is TDD process documentation

### **Test Standards**  
- **TDD methodology validation**: Document must demonstrate proper RED-GREEN-REFACTOR examples
- **Decision framework testing**: Validate decision tree with real project scenarios
- **Performance metrics validation**: Ensure quality gates are achievable with current infrastructure

### **Testing Framework Requirements**
- **TDD examples**: Must use Vitest + @testing-library/react patterns
- **Mock examples**: Demonstrate TDD with vi.mock() and MSW patterns
- **Performance examples**: Show TDD workflow with watch mode and rapid iteration

### **Specific Testing Requirements**
- **Beyond existing patterns**: TDD examples must not simply copy MultiStepForm.test.tsx approach
- **Proper methodology**: Examples must show test-first development, not post-facto testing
- **Real-world applicability**: TDD examples must be practical for project's technology stack
- **Quality gate validation**: Coverage thresholds and performance targets must be realistic

### Implementation Quality Assessment

**✅ STORY COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

This story establishes comprehensive TDD process documentation that addresses the fundamental gap: transforming from **post-facto testing** to proper **test-driven development methodology**.

### Story Completion Details

**File Created:**
- `docs/reference/tdd-process-guide.md` - Comprehensive 800+ line TDD methodology guide

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Methodology Foundation**: Established proper RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle with clear rules and timing
2. **Decision Framework**: Created comprehensive decision trees for when/how to apply TDD
3. **Practical Examples**: Provided 4 complete TDD examples (utility, API, hook, schema)
4. **Infrastructure Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing Vitest + RTL setup
5. **Quality Gates**: Established measurable coverage thresholds and performance metrics
6. **Templates & Scaffolding**: Created copy-paste templates for rapid TDD adoption

function calculateTax(amount, rate) { return amount * rate * 0.01 }
test('calculates tax', () => { expect(calculateTax(100, 10)).toBe(10) })
```

**To (Proper TDD):**
```tsx
// ✅ Test-first drives implementation
test('calculates tax correctly', () => { expect(calculateTax(100, 10)).toBe(10) })
function calculateTax(amount, rate) { return amount * (rate / 100) }
```
