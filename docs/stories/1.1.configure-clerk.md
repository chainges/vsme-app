# Story 1.1: Install & Configure Clerk

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to install the @clerk/nextjs package and update environment variables,
**so that** Clerk is available for authentication with SSO support for the sister app on the same domain.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The @clerk/nextjs package is installed in the project.
2. Environment variables are updated to include all necessary Clerk credentials and SSO configuration settings.
3. The authentication configuration is verified to work seamlessly with the sister app, sharing the same login session across the domain.
4. Documentation is updated with the installation and configuration steps for future reference.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Install @clerk/nextjs package using npm/pnpm
  - [ ] Verify package compatibility with Next.js 14+
  - [ ] Update package.json dependencies
- [ ] Configure environment variables
  - [ ] Add Clerk API keys (CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, CLERK_SECRET_KEY)
  - [ ] Add SSO configuration (CLERK_DOMAIN, CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL, CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL)
  - [ ] Update .env.example and .env.local files
- [ ] Verify SSO functionality
  - [ ] Test authentication flow with sister app domain
  - [ ] Confirm shared login session across domains
  - [ ] Validate JWT token sharing
- [ ] Update documentation
  - [ ] Add installation steps to README
  - [ ] Document environment variable setup
  - [ ] Include SSO configuration guide

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Architecture Information:**
- Clerk is the definitive authentication service (from architecture.md section 2)
- SSO support required for sister app integration on same domain
- Next.js 14+ with App Router (from tech stack)
- Environment variables follow standard Next.js patterns
- JWT authentication for API calls (from API contract)

**Source Tree Information:**
- Frontend: apps/web/ (Next.js application)
- Environment files: apps/web/.env.local, apps/web/.env.example
- Package management: Root package.json or apps/web/package.json

**Technical Context:**
- Clerk integrates with Next.js middleware for route protection
- SSO configuration requires domain settings in Clerk dashboard
- Environment variables must be prefixed with CLERK_
- Authentication state managed via Clerk hooks and components

## Testing
**Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- ESLint for code quality (root .eslintrc.js)
- Prettier for code formatting (root prettier.config.js)
- TypeScript for type safety across monorepo
- Testing frameworks: Follow architecture guidelines for unit/integration tests

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Unit tests for environment variable validation
- Integration tests for Clerk configuration
- E2E tests for SSO login flow
- Build verification to ensure no compilation errors
