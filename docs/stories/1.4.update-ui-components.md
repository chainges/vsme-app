# Story 1.4: Update UI Components

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to interact with sign-in and sign-out buttons that use Clerk's SignInButton, SignOutButton, or UserButton,
**so that** I have a seamless authentication experience.
**As a** developer,
**I want** to replace any mock authentication components with those utilizing Clerk.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Identify all UI components that handle authentication (e.g., sign-in/sign-out buttons, user profile displays) in apps/web/src/components/.
2. Replace mock or custom authentication components with Clerk's built-in components (SignInButton, SignOutButton, UserButton).
3. Ensure the new components are styled consistently with the app's design system.
4. Test the updated components to confirm they integrate properly with Clerk's authentication flow.
5. Verify that user interactions (sign-in, sign-out, profile access) work seamlessly across the app.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Inventory existing auth components
  - [ ] Scan apps/web/src/components/ for auth-related components
  - [ ] Identify mock/custom auth buttons and user displays
  - [ ] Document current component interfaces and styling
- [ ] Plan Clerk component integration
  - [ ] Map existing components to Clerk equivalents
  - [ ] Review Clerk component customization options
  - [ ] Plan styling approach for design consistency
- [ ] Replace authentication components
  - [ ] Import Clerk components (SignInButton, SignOutButton, UserButton)
  - [ ] Replace mock components with Clerk components
  - [ ] Apply consistent styling and theming
- [ ] Update component styling
  - [ ] Ensure Clerk components match design system
  - [ ] Add custom CSS/Tailwind classes as needed
  - [ ] Verify responsive design and accessibility
- [ ] Test component integration
  - [ ] Test sign-in/sign-out flows
  - [ ] Verify user profile display functionality
  - [ ] Confirm seamless integration with auth flow

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Architecture Information:**
- shadcn/ui component library (from tech stack)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (from tech stack)
- Clerk authentication components integration
- Design system consistency requirements
- Accessibility standards compliance

**Source Tree Information:**
- Components directory: apps/web/src/components/
- Auth components: apps/web/src/components/auth/
- UI library: apps/web/src/components/ui/
- Layout components: apps/web/src/components/layout/
- Theme provider: apps/web/src/components/layout/theme-provider.tsx

**Technical Context:**
- Clerk components: SignInButton, SignOutButton, UserButton
- Must integrate with existing shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Responsive design requirements
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)
- TypeScript integration with Clerk types

## Testing
**Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- ESLint for code quality (root .eslintrc.js)
- Prettier for code formatting (root prettier.config.js)
- TypeScript for type safety across monorepo
- React Testing Library for component testing

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Unit tests for updated components
- Integration tests with Clerk authentication
- Visual regression tests for styling consistency
- Accessibility testing for Clerk components
- E2E tests for authentication flows
