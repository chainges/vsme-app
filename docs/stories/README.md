## Story Management

### BMAD Story Types

1. **Brownfield Addition Stories** (like Story 8)
   - For isolated enhancements that can be completed in one session
   - Follow existing patterns exactly
   - Minimal integration complexity
   - Clear rollback capability

2. **Brownfield Enhancement Stories** (for more complex features)
   - May require multiple sessions
   - Some design work needed
   - Multiple integration points
   - Use brownfield-create-epic instead

### Story Creation Process

- **Single Stories:** Use `*create-brownfield-story` command
- **Multiple Stories:** Use `*create-brownfield-epic` command
- **Story Execution:** Use `*execute-checklist` for quality gates
- **Story Validation:** Use `*correct-course` if requirements change

### Story Execution Workflow

1. **Story Creation:** Define requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Implementation:** Develop functionality following existing patterns
3. **Testing:** Verify functionality and integration
4. **Validation:** Ensure no regression in existing features
5. **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation
6. **Story Completion:** Mark story as done and prepare for next

## Current Focus

**Story 8: MultiStepForm Controller Component** is the current active story that will:

- Create the core form orchestration component
- Integrate with TanStack Forms for state management
- Implement step navigation and validation
- Add automatic data persistence and restoration
- Follow existing component composition patterns
