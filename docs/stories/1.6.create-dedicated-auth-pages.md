# Story 1.6: Create Dedicated Auth Pages

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** dedicated sign-in and sign-up pages using Clerk components,
**so that** my authentication experience is clear and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create dedicated sign-in page (e.g., /sign-in) using Clerk's SignIn component.
2. Create dedicated sign-up page (e.g., /sign-up) using Clerk's SignUp component.
3. Ensure the pages are styled consistently with the app's design and are responsive.
4. Configure the pages to support SSO with the sister app on the same domain.
5. Test the pages to confirm they handle authentication flows correctly and redirect appropriately after sign-in/sign-up.
6. Update navigation or routing to direct users to these pages when needed.

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Architecture Information:**
- Next.js 14+ with App Router (from tech stack)
- Clerk SignIn and SignUp components
- SSO support for sister app (from architecture.md)
- shadcn/ui for consistent design (from tech stack)
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Netlify deployment platform

**Source Tree Information:**
- Auth pages location: apps/web/src/app/(auth)/
- Sign-in page: apps/web/src/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx
- Sign-up page: apps/web/src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx
- Layout: apps/web/src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx
- Navigation components: apps/web/src/components/navigation/

**Technical Context:**
- Clerk components: <SignIn />, <SignUp />
- App Router route groups for auth pages
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- SSO requires domain configuration
- Integration with middleware redirects
- Consistent theming with shadcn/ui

## Testing
**Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- ESLint for code quality (root .eslintrc.js)
- Prettier for code formatting (root prettier.config.js)
- TypeScript for type safety across monorepo
- E2E testing for authentication flows

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Unit tests for auth page components
- Integration tests for Clerk components
- E2E tests for complete auth flows
- SSO testing for cross-domain authentication
- Responsive design testing
