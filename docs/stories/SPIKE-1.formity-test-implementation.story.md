# Story SPIKE-1: Formity Test Implementation & Library Evaluation

**Status:** Complete  
**Priority:** Medium (Learning/Research)  
**Estimated Effort:** 5-8 hours (Spike/Research)  
**Dependencies:** None (Independent learning spike)  
**Story Type:** Research Spike / Technology Evaluation

## Story

**As a** development team,  
**I want** to implement a proof-of-concept multi-step form using Formity with our existing TanStack Forms as the backend,  
**so that** I can evaluate whether Formity's JSON schema abstraction adds value to our current implementation and validate its claim of being form-library agnostic.

## Story Context

**Research Problem:**
- Current TanStack Forms implementation is complex for multi-step scenarios
- Formity claims to be form-library agnostic with JSON schema orchestration
- Need to validate if Formity works with our existing TanStack Forms investment
- Evaluate if JSON schema abstraction justifies additional dependency

**Learning Objectives:**
- Test Formity's agnostic capabilities with TanStack Forms backend
- Evaluate JSON schema approach vs current form configuration
- Assess integration complexity with existing TanStack Forms patterns
- Determine if Formity reduces multi-step form complexity
- Document migration effort and compatibility findings

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **TanStack Forms Integration**: Formity library successfully integrated with existing TanStack Forms as backend engine
2. **Multi-Step Functionality**: Working 3 step test form with step navigation controls  
3. **Field Type Support**: Basic field types implemented (text, email, select, textarea) using our shadcn/ui components
4. **Validation Integration**: Field-level and step-level validation working correctly
5. **State Persistence**: Form state persists between steps and browser refreshes
6. **Design System Integration**: Form uses existing shadcn/ui components where possible
7. **Test Coverage**: Proper TDD implementation with test coverage for spike functionality
8. **Documentation**: Comprehensive findings document with pros/cons and recommendations
9. **Agnostic Validation**: Validates Formity's form-library agnostic claims with TanStack Forms backend
10. **Performance Assessment**: Basic performance evaluation compared to current approach
11. **Accessibility Compliance**: Maintains WCAG 2.1 AA standards throughout implementation
12. **Migration Assessment**: Clear assessment of migration effort and recommendation for Formity adoption

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Current Form Implementation:** [Source: Frontend Architecture - Multi-Step Form Architecture]
- TanStack Form for state management and validation
- Automatic persistence to localStorage
- MultiStepForm component orchestrates entire form flow
- Current step tracking, form data state, validation state
- Navigation between steps with progress indicators

**shadcn/ui Integration:** [Source: Frontend Architecture - UI Component Library]
- `cn` function for conditional class merging with tailwind-merge
- Component variants using `cva` (class-variance-authority)
- Consistent design system with TailwindCSS utilities
- Theme-aware variants for light/dark modes

**Technology Stack:** [Source: Technology Stack]
- Frontend: Next.js 15.3.0, React 19, TypeScript
- UI Components: shadcn/ui (New York style)
- Styling: TailwindCSS 4.1.11
- Testing: Vitest + Testing Library, jsdom environment
- Runtime: Bun 1.2.19+

### Formity Integration Strategy

**Library Understanding:**
- Formity claims to be a JSON schema-based abstraction layer over form libraries
- Default implementation uses React Hook Form, but claims form-library agnostic support
- Provides component orchestration through JSON schema configuration
- Offers step navigation, state persistence, validation out-of-box
- Documentation available through context7 mcp
- **Key Question**: Can it actually work with TanStack Forms as backend?

**Integration Strategy (Prioritized):**

**Primary Approach: TanStack Forms Backend**
```typescript
// Test if Formity can use TanStack Forms
interface FormityTanStackConfig {
  backend: 'tanstack' // Attempt to use existing TanStack Forms
  schema: {
    steps: Array<{
      title: string
      fields: Array<{
        name: string
        type: 'text' | 'email' | 'select' | 'textarea'
        validation: TanStackFieldValidator // Leverage existing validation
        props?: Record<string, any>
      }>
    }>
  }
  components: {
    // Reuse existing shadcn/ui + TanStack Forms integration
    text: TextField // Current TanStack Forms field
    email: EmailField
    select: SelectField
    textarea: TextareaField
  }
}
```

**Fallback Approach: React Hook Form Backend**
```typescript
// If TanStack Forms integration fails
interface FormityReactHookFormConfig {
  backend: 'react-hook-form' // Formity's default
  // ... rest of configuration
}
```
```

### Testing Requirements

**Test Framework:** [Source: Testing Strategy]
- Vitest with jsdom environment for browser-like DOM simulation
- React Testing Library for component testing
- TDD approach with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
- Global access to testing utilities enabled

**Test Standards:**
- Environment: jsdom for React component testing
- Setup Files: Proper test-setup.ts configuration
- Module Aliases: @ alias pointing to src directory
- Coverage: Aim for >80% coverage on spike functionality

**Test Scenarios:**
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('Formity Integration', () => {
  test('initializes with JSON schema configuration')
  test('renders fields using shadcn/ui components')
  test('validates fields through JSON schema')
  test('handles step navigation correctly')
  test('persists form state across steps')
  test('integrates with existing design system')
})
```

### Performance Considerations

**Benchmarking Requirements:**
- Form initialization time (target: <200ms)
- Step navigation responsiveness (target: <100ms)
- Memory usage comparison with current implementation
- Bundle size impact of adding Formity dependency

### Accessibility Standards

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** [Source: Accessibility Requirements]
- All form controls must have proper labels
- Keyboard navigation support throughout form
- Screen reader compatibility for step navigation
- Color contrast requirements for validation states
- Focus management during step transitions

### Expected Challenges

**Primary Challenge: TanStack Forms Compatibility**
- Determining if Formity actually supports TanStack Forms backend
- Mapping existing TanStack Forms patterns to Formity JSON schema
- Ensuring validation and field registration compatibility
- Preserving existing form utilities and patterns

**Secondary Challenges:**
- Ensuring shadcn/ui component props compatibility
- Managing TypeScript types between three libraries (Formity + TanStack + shadcn)
- Performance impact of additional abstraction layer

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Compatibility**: Does Formity work with TanStack Forms?
- **Migration Effort**: How much existing code needs to change?
- **Value Add**: Does JSON schema abstraction simplify multi-step forms?
- **Performance**: Bundle size and runtime overhead
- **Maintenance**: Long-term compatibility and update concerns

  - Claims of "compatibility with any form library" are misleading
  - Successfully implemented working Formity multi-step form with shadcn/ui
  - Created detailed compatibility assessment and alternative recommendations
- [x] Task 4: Implemented field types with shadcn/ui (Text, Email, Select, Textarea, Checkbox, Number)
- [x] Task 5: Multi-step navigation working with 3 steps and progress tracking
- [x] Task 6: Validation and state management implemented with Zod and form persistence
- [x] Task 7: Core implementation working (form renders, navigation works, validation active)
- [x] Task 8: Performance assessment completed - Formity adds overhead vs current implementation
