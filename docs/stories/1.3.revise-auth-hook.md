# Story 1.3: Revise Authentication Hook

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to update the custom authentication hook to integrate Clerk's authentication methods,
**so that** user extraction and state management work seamlessly with Clerk.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Identify and locate the existing custom authentication hook in the codebase (e.g., in apps/web/src/hooks/).
2. Update the hook to use Clerk's authentication methods (e.g., useUser, useAuth) for user data extraction and state management.
3. Ensure the hook provides the same interface as before to avoid breaking changes in components that use it.
4. Test the updated hook to confirm it correctly retrieves and manages user authentication state.
5. Verify integration with the root layout's ClerkProvider for proper context access.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Locate existing authentication hook
  - [ ] Search apps/web/src/hooks/ for auth-related hooks
  - [ ] Identify current hook interface and usage
  - [ ] Document existing hook behavior and return values
- [ ] Analyze Clerk hook integration
  - [ ] Review Clerk's useUser and useAuth hooks
  - [ ] Map existing hook interface to Clerk equivalents
  - [ ] Plan backward compatibility approach
- [ ] Update hook implementation
  - [ ] Replace custom logic with Clerk hooks
  - [ ] Maintain existing return interface
  - [ ] Add error handling for Clerk states
- [ ] Test hook functionality
  - [ ] Verify user data extraction works
  - [ ] Test authentication state management
  - [ ] Confirm no breaking changes in using components
- [ ] Update component integrations
  - [ ] Review all components using the hook
  - [ ] Ensure compatibility with updated hook
  - [ ] Test authentication flows in components

## Dev Notes
**Relevant Architecture Information:**
- Clerk authentication service (from architecture.md)
- Next.js 14+ with App Router (from tech stack)
- TypeScript for type safety (from tech stack)
- Hook-based state management pattern

**Source Tree Information:**
- Hooks directory: apps/web/src/hooks/
- Components using hooks: apps/web/src/components/
- Authentication components: apps/web/src/components/auth/
- Layout with ClerkProvider: apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx

**Technical Context:**
- Clerk hooks: useUser, useAuth, useClerk
- Existing hook likely manages user state and auth status
- Must maintain interface for component compatibility
- Integration with ClerkProvider from Story 1.2
- TypeScript interfaces must align with Clerk types

## Testing
**Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- ESLint for code quality (root .eslintrc.js)
- Prettier for code formatting (root prettier.config.js)
- TypeScript for type safety across monorepo
- React Testing Library for hook testing

**Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Unit tests for updated hook functionality
- Integration tests with ClerkProvider
- Component tests for hook usage
- Type checking verification
