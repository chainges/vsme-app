# MultiStepForm Controller Component - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a developer,
I want a main MultiStepForm controller component that orchestrates the entire form flow,
So that I can create reusable multi-step forms with TanStack Forms integration and step-based navigation.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing form field components, storage providers, and UI patterns
- Technology: TanStack Forms, React 19, TypeScript, existing shadcn/ui components
- Follows pattern: Component composition pattern used throughout the app
- Touch points: Form field components, storage abstraction layer, validation schemas

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. MultiStepForm component accepts form configuration with steps, validation schemas, and submission handlers
2. Component manages step navigation with next/previous functionality and validation checks
3. Form state is automatically persisted to local storage on step completion
4. Form state is restored from local storage on component mount

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing form field components continue to work unchanged
5. New functionality follows existing component composition pattern
6. Integration with storage providers maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Change is covered by appropriate tests
8. Documentation is updated if needed
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Creates a new controller component that orchestrates existing field components and storage providers
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows the component composition pattern used in layout components and navigation
- **Key Constraints:** Must integrate with TanStack Forms, support step-based validation, and maintain existing field component interfaces

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Complex form logic could introduce bugs affecting existing functionality
- **Mitigation:** Isolated component with clear interfaces, comprehensive testing
- **Rollback:** Component can be removed without affecting existing form field components

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [x] Performance impact is negligible

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

```typescript
// apps/web/src/components/forms/multi-step/MultiStepForm.tsx
interface MultiStepFormProps<T = any> {
  config: MultiStepFormConfig<T>
  onStepChange?: (currentStep: number, totalSteps: number) => void
  onFormComplete?: (data: T) => void
}

export function MultiStepForm<T>({ config, onStepChange, onFormComplete }: MultiStepFormProps<T>) {
  // Implementation using TanStack Forms
  // Step navigation logic
  // Storage integration
  // Validation handling
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Step Management:** Current step tracking, navigation validation
2. **Form State:** TanStack Forms integration with step-based validation
3. **Storage Integration:** Automatic persistence and restoration
4. **Navigation Controls:** Next/previous buttons with validation
5. **Progress Tracking:** Step completion indicators

### Integration Points

- **Form Field Components:** Renders existing field components based on configuration
- **Storage Providers:** Uses LocalStorageProvider for data persistence
- **Validation Schemas:** Integrates with Zod schemas for step validation
- **UI Components:** Leverages existing shadcn/ui components for layout

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Component renders correctly with different configurations
- Step navigation works as expected
- Form state management functions properly
- Storage integration saves and restores data correctly

### Integration Tests

- Works with existing form field components
- Integrates properly with storage providers
- Validation schemas are applied correctly
- Navigation controls function as expected

### Regression Tests

- Existing form field components continue to work
- Storage providers maintain current behavior
- UI patterns remain consistent
- Performance is not degraded

## Success Metrics

- [ ] MultiStepForm component renders without errors
- [ ] Step navigation functions correctly
- [ ] Form state persists and restores properly
- [ ] Integration with existing components works seamlessly
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Component follows existing code patterns and standards

## Dependencies

- TanStack Forms (@tanstack/react-form)
- Existing form field components
- Storage abstraction layer
- Validation schemas (Zod)
- Existing UI component library (shadcn/ui)

## Estimated Effort

**Development Time:** 3-4 hours
**Testing Time:** 1-2 hours
**Total:** 4-6 hours (within single development session scope)

## Next Steps

1. Implement MultiStepForm component
2. Add comprehensive testing
3. Verify integration with existing components
4. Update documentation
5. Prepare for next story (Story 9: Step Renderer and Configuration System)
