## Executive Summary
This risk mitigation plan provides a detailed approach for safely implementing the multi-step form restructure while addressing all identified risks from the risk assessment and QA gate decision. The plan follows a phased approach with continuous validation to ensure code quality and functionality are maintained throughout the process.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies by Category

### 1. Technical Risks

#### RISK-01: Broken Import Paths (HIGH PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Automated Import Path Update**:
   - Use search and replace tools to systematically update import paths
   - Create a mapping document of old paths to new paths before starting
   - Use TypeScript's refactoring capabilities in VS Code for safe renaming

2. **Incremental Validation**:
   - Run `bun check-types` after each batch of import updates
   - Verify no compilation errors before proceeding to next phase
   - Use `git status` to identify all modified files and ensure none are missed

3. **Verification Process**:
   - Create a checklist of all files that reference multi-step form components
   - Manually verify critical import paths after automated updates
   - Test form functionality in browser after each import path update

#### RISK-02: Loss of Test Coverage (MEDIUM PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Test File Migration**:
   - Move test files in tandem with their corresponding components
   - Maintain the same test file names and directory structure
   - Update import paths in test files immediately after moving

2. **Coverage Verification**:
   - Run `bun test:run` before and after each phase to ensure test count remains consistent
   - Use `bun test --coverage` to verify coverage percentage doesn't decrease
   - Add new tests for any uncovered functionality identified during the move

3. **TDD Approach**:
   - Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles throughout the process
   - Write tests for new structure before implementing changes
   - Verify all existing tests pass after each move operation

#### RISK-03: Runtime Errors (MEDIUM PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Continuous Browser Testing**:
   - Test form in browser after each step using `bun dev:web`
   - Check browser console for errors after each change
   - Verify all form transitions work correctly after each phase

2. **Functional Verification**:
   - Test all form steps sequentially after each phase
   - Verify form submission works correctly
   - Check that all conditional logic still functions as expected

3. **Error Monitoring**:
   - Enable detailed logging during development
   - Monitor for hydration errors or React rendering issues
   - Verify no new console warnings or errors appear

#### RISK-04: Build Process Failures (LOW PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Continuous Build Verification**:
   - Run `bun build` after each major change
   - Verify successful compilation before moving to next phase
   - Check for missing dependencies or incorrect configurations

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Ensure all external references are properly updated
   - Verify package.json dependencies remain consistent
   - Check for any new build warnings or errors

### 2. Process Risks

#### RISK-05: Time Overrun (MEDIUM PROBABILITY, MEDIUM IMPACT)
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Phased Implementation**:
   - Break down tasks into smaller units as defined in the story
   - Estimate time for each subtask with buffer for unexpected issues
   - Plan for integration testing time between phases

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Update story task checklist after each completed phase
   - Document time spent on each phase for future reference
   - Communicate delays early to team

#### RISK-06: Incomplete Functionality Preservation (LOW PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Comprehensive Test Plan**:
   - Create test plan before starting that covers all acceptance criteria
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are met after each phase
   - Perform end-to-end testing of the complete form flow

2. **Acceptance Criteria Verification**:
   - Test each acceptance criterion individually
   - Document test results for each criterion
   - Ensure no functionality is lost during the restructure

#### RISK-07: Confusion During Parallel Development (MEDIUM PROBABILITY, MEDIUM IMPACT)
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Team Communication**:
   - Communicate changes to team before starting
   - Coordinate with other developers working on related components
   - Use feature branches for all changes

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update documentation immediately after each phase
   - Keep team informed of progress through daily standups
   - Create a migration guide for reference

#### RISK-08: Inconsistent Code Standards (LOW PROBABILITY, MEDIUM IMPACT)
**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Code Quality Enforcement**:
   - Follow existing project standards for TypeScript and React
   - Use linting tools (Biome) to enforce code standards
   - Conduct code reviews for all changes

2. **Formatting Consistency**:
   - Apply Biome formatting to all new and modified files
   - Ensure no semicolons are used per project standards
   - Maintain strict TypeScript mode with zero `any` types

## Phased Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Preparation and Setup
**Objective**: Establish the new directory structure and prepare for migration
**Tasks**:
1. Create new `steps/` directory with subdirectories for each step
2. Set up proper `__tests__` directories for each step
3. Create initial index files for new structure
4. Document current import paths and create mapping to new paths
5. Run baseline tests and capture current test coverage

**Validation**:
- Verify new directory structure matches target structure
- Confirm all index files are properly configured
- Ensure baseline tests still pass

### Phase 2: Component Migration (Step by Step)
**Objective**: Migrate components step-by-step while maintaining functionality

#### Phase 2a: Step 1 - Company Info
**Tasks**:
1. Move company info related files to `step-1-company-info/`
2. Move company-info.ts schema to `step-1-company-info/schema.ts`
3. Move existing tests to `step-1-company-info/__tests__/`
4. Update import paths in affected files
5. Update main multi-step form to use new imports

**Validation**:
- Run type checking: `bun check-types`
- Run tests: `bun test:run`
- Test in browser: `bun dev:web`
- Verify build: `bun build`

- Run tests: `bun test:run`
- Test in browser: `bun dev:web`
- Verify build: `bun build`

### Phase 3: Integration and Finalization
**Objective**: Complete integration and verify all functionality

**Tasks**:
1. Update step configurations to reference new structure
2. Update external references (page components, etc.)
3. Update all remaining import paths throughout the codebase
4. Run comprehensive type checking
5. Run all tests and verify coverage
6. Test form in browser to ensure it works correctly
7. Verify build process succeeds
8. Update documentation

**Validation**:
- All acceptance criteria pass
- All existing tests pass
- No console errors in browser
- Build process succeeds
- Type checking passes without errors

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues arise during any phase:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Stop all development work
   - Document the issue with screenshots/logs
   - Notify team lead and QA

2. **Rollback Steps**:
   - Use `git stash` or `git reset` to revert to last known good state
   - If using feature branch, delete branch and start over
   - Restore from backup if necessary

3. **Issue Resolution**:
   - Analyze root cause of the issue
   - Develop fix in separate branch
   - Test fix thoroughly before re-attempting restructure

## Continuous Monitoring and Validation

### Automated Checks
- Run `bun check-types` after each import path update
- Run `bun test:run` after each component move
- Run `bun build` after each major change
- Use `bun lint` to ensure code quality standards

### Manual Verification
- Test form functionality in browser after each phase
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all form steps work correctly
- Confirm no visual regressions

### Team Communication
- Daily standup updates on progress
- Immediate notification of any blocking issues
- Documentation updates as changes are made
- Code reviews for all significant changes

## Success Criteria

The restructure will be considered successful when:
1. All 18 acceptance criteria are met
2. All existing tests pass
3. No new console errors appear in browser
4. Build process succeeds without errors
5. Type checking passes without errors
6. Code follows project standards for TypeScript and React
7. Risk mitigation strategies have been successfully implemented
