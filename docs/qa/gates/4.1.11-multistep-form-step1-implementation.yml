# Technical architecture assessment
architecture_assessment:
  significance: HIGH
  rationale: "Establishes foundational pattern for all future multi-step forms"
  extensibility: EXCELLENT
  patterns_established:
    - "Multi-step form configuration system"
    - "Unified field validation with Zod"
    - "LocalStorage persistence abstraction"
    - "TanStack Form integration pattern"

# Test environment analysis
