## Story Information
- **Story**: Restructure Multi-Step Form Files for Better Organization
- **Story File**: multi-step-form-restructure.md
- **Assessment Date**: 2025-08-30
- **Assessor**: Quinn (QA Assistant)

## Executive Summary
This risk assessment evaluates the potential risks associated with restructuring the multi-step form files to improve organization. The restructure involves moving files to a step-based directory structure while preserving all existing functionality. Overall risk is assessed as **MEDIUM** with several manageable risks that can be mitigated through proper planning and execution.

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### RISK-01: Broken Import Paths (HIGH PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)
**Description**: The restructure involves moving many files to new locations, which will break existing import paths. With numerous interdependent components, there's a high probability of missing some import updates.

**Impact**: 
- Build failures
- Runtime errors
- Development delays
- Potential for missed broken paths

**Mitigation**:
- Use automated tools to identify and update import paths
- Run type checking after each batch of changes
- Test incrementally rather than all at once
- Maintain a checklist of all files that need path updates

### RISK-02: Loss of Test Coverage (MEDIUM PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)
**Description**: Moving test files alongside components could result in lost tests or broken test configurations, leading to reduced test coverage.

**Impact**:
- Reduced confidence in code quality
- Potential introduction of bugs
- Delayed detection of issues
- Need for additional testing time

**Mitigation**:
- Move tests in tandem with components
- Verify all tests pass after each move
- Maintain TDD approach throughout the process
- Add new tests for any functionality gaps identified

### RISK-03: Runtime Errors (MEDIUM PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)
**Description**: Even with passing tests, there may be runtime errors in the browser due to incorrect imports, missing dependencies, or misconfigured components.

**Impact**:
- Broken user experience
- Form functionality issues
- Need for debugging and fixes
- Potential rollback required

**Mitigation**:
- Test form in browser after each step
- Monitor browser console for errors
- Verify all form transitions work correctly
- Perform end-to-end testing of the complete flow

### RISK-04: Build Process Failures (LOW PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)
**Description**: The restructure could introduce build process failures due to missing dependencies, incorrect configurations, or TypeScript errors.

**Impact**:
- Inability to deploy
- Development environment issues
- Team productivity impact
- Potential for cascading issues

**Mitigation**:
- Run build process after each major change
- Verify successful compilation before moving on
- Check for missing dependencies
- Ensure all external references are properly updated

## Risk Monitoring Plan
1. **Daily Check-ins**: Monitor progress and identify emerging risks
2. **Automated Testing**: Run full test suite after each significant change
3. **Type Checking**: Run type checking continuously during the restructure
4. **Browser Testing**: Test form functionality in browser regularly
5. **Build Verification**: Verify successful builds at key milestones
6. **Team Communication**: Keep team informed of changes and potential impacts

## Risk Thresholds
- **GREEN (Low Risk)**: Risk score 1-3 - Proceed as planned
- **YELLOW (Medium Risk)**: Risk score 4-6 - Monitor closely, implement mitigations
- **RED (High Risk)**: Risk score 7-9 - Escalate, consider alternative approaches

## Recommendations
1. **Phased Approach**: Implement the restructure in phases rather than all at once
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Maintain full test coverage throughout the process
3. **Communication**: Keep the development team informed of changes
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as changes are made
5. **Backup Plan**: Have a rollback plan in case of critical issues

## Approval
This risk profile has been reviewed and approved for the multi-step form restructure implementation.
