## üìã **Remaining Tasks for Sprint Planning**

### **Task Group 1: Form Accessibility** 
**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 15 minutes | **Risk:** Low

**Issue:** 3 tests expect explicit `role="form"` attribute
```
Unable to find an accessible element with the role "form"
```

**Solution:** 
- Option A: Add `role="form"` to form elements
- Option B: Update tests to use `getByRole('form')` ‚Üí `getByTagName('form')`

**Assignment:** Junior Developer
**Acceptance Criteria:** Form role tests pass

---

### **Task Group 2: Radix UI Component Mocking**
**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 30 minutes | **Risk:** Medium

**Issue:** 4 tests fail due to missing Radix UI browser APIs
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'prototype')
ReferenceError: ResizeObserver is not defined
```

**Solution:** Extend test-setup.ts with Radix-specific mocks
```typescript
// Additional mocks needed:
global.HTMLElement.prototype.setPointerCapture = vi.fn()
global.HTMLElement.prototype.releasePointerCapture = vi.fn() 
global.HTMLElement.prototype.hasPointerCapture = vi.fn()
```

**Assignment:** Senior Developer (complex mocking)
**Acceptance Criteria:** SelectField and CheckboxField tests pass

---

### **Task Group 3: Field Array Component Polish**
**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** 45 minutes | **Risk:** Low

**Issue:** 8 tests with button label mismatches and DOM timing
```
Unable to find an accessible element with the role "button" and name `/remove subsidiary 1/i`
Expected container to be an Element, a Document or a DocumentFragment
```

**Solution:** 
- Fix button aria-label patterns
- Replace remaining `waitFor` with `findBy*` methods
- Review component vs. test expectations

**Assignment:** Mid-level Developer  
**Acceptance Criteria:** Field Array tests stable and passing

---

### **Task Group 4: Progress Indicator Edge Cases**
**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** 10 minutes | **Risk:** Very Low

**Issue:** 2 tests with multiple element matching
```
Found multiple elements with the text: Step 2
```

**Solution:** Use more specific selectors or `getAllByText`
**Assignment:** Junior Developer
**Acceptance Criteria:** No ambiguous element matching

---

### **Task Group 5: Storage Integration Refinement**
**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** 30 minutes | **Risk:** Low

**Issue:** 6 tests with mock storage configuration
```
expected "spy" to be called with arguments: [ 'test-form' ]
```

**Solution:** Review storage provider mock setup
**Assignment:** Mid-level Developer
**Acceptance Criteria:** Storage integration tests pass

---

### **Task Group 6: Conditional Logic Edge Case**
**Priority:** Very Low | **Effort:** 15 minutes | **Risk:** Very Low  

**Issue:** 1 test with dynamic visibility
```
expected element not to be in document
```

**Solution:** Fix condition evaluation timing
**Assignment:** Any Developer
**Acceptance Criteria:** Conditional visibility test passes

---

## üìà **Sprint Planning Recommendations**

### **Immediate Next Sprint:**
1. **Task Group 2** (Radix UI) - **Must have** for component library reliability
2. **Task Group 1** (Form roles) - **Should have** for accessibility compliance

### **Following Sprint:**
3. **Task Group 3** (Field Arrays) - **Could have** for test suite completeness
4. **Task Group 4** (Progress) - **Could have** for test reliability

### **Future Sprints:**
5. **Task Group 5** (Storage) - **Won't have** this sprint (not critical)
6. **Task Group 6** (Conditional) - **Won't have** this sprint (edge case)

## üéØ **Success Metrics for Completion**

### **Definition of Done for Remaining Tasks:**
- [ ] All 180 tests passing consistently
- [ ] No flaky test behavior across multiple runs
- [ ] Test execution time remains under 10 seconds
- [ ] No console errors during test execution
- [ ] All component mocking comprehensive and stable

### **Quality Gates:**
- **Minimum:** 95% test success rate (171/180 tests)
- **Target:** 100% test success rate (180/180 tests)
- **Performance:** Test suite completes in <10 seconds

---

## üíº **Resource Requirements**

### **Developer Skills Needed:**
- **Junior Dev Skills:** DOM testing, basic assertions, test debugging
- **Mid-level Dev Skills:** Component testing, async behavior, mock configuration  
- **Senior Dev Skills:** Complex mocking, browser API simulation, Radix UI internals

### **Time Allocation Estimate:**
- **Sprint Points:** 3 points total (2.25 hours)
- **Sprint Capacity:** Can be distributed across multiple developers
- **Timeline:** Complete within 1-2 sprints depending on priority

---

## üö® **Risk Assessment**

### **Low Risks:**
- Tasks are isolated and don't affect production code
- Easy rollback if changes cause issues
- No external dependencies or API changes required

### **Medium Risks:**
- Radix UI mocking may uncover additional compatibility issues
- Component behavior vs. test expectations may need alignment

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
- Test changes incrementally
- Maintain backup of current working configuration
- Document any component behavior changes
