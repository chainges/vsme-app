# Story 4.1.11 Validation Handover Document

**To:** Product Manager  
**From:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Subject:** Story 4.1.11 - Required Fixes Before Development  
**Status:** ‚ùå **BLOCKED - Requires PM Review and Updates**

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Story 4.1.11 (MultiStep Form Step 1 Implementation) has been validated and requires critical updates before development can begin. The story has a solid foundation with good TDD approach, but is missing essential implementation details that would block or confuse the development team.

**Current Readiness Score:** 6/10  
**Required Score for Development:** 8/10 minimum

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED (Must Fix)

### 1. **Field List Inconsistency**

**Issue:** Acceptance Criteria #2 lists 9 fields, but Dev Notes specify 10 fields.

**Missing Field in AC#2:**
- Contact person email

**Action Required:**
Update AC#2 to include all 10 fields:
```
2. Step 1 includes all company fields: name, organization number, country, 
   NACE code, industry, revenue, balance sheet value, employees, 
   contact person name, contact person email
```

---

### 2. **Missing File Creation Tasks**

**Issue:** Dev Notes mention file locations but Task list doesn't include explicit file creation subtasks.

**Action Required:**
Add to Task 2 the following subtasks:
```markdown
- [ ] **Task 2: Create Step 1 Form Configuration** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create `apps/web/src/lib/forms/types/general-info-step1-types.ts` with GeneralInfoStep1Data interface
  - [ ] Create `apps/web/src/lib/forms/validation/general-info-step1-schemas.ts` with Zod schemas
  - [ ] Create `apps/web/src/lib/forms/configs/general-info-step1-config.ts` with form configuration
  - [ ] Define GeneralInfoStep1Data TypeScript interface
  - [ ] Create Zod schema for company information fields
  - [ ] Create form configuration with single step
  - [ ] Map fields to existing field registry components
```

---

### 3. **Validation Rules Not Specified**

**Issue:** No specific validation rules for fields that need them.

**Action Required:**
Add a new section in Dev Notes called "Field Validation Rules":

```markdown
### Field Validation Rules

- **Company name**: Required, min 2 characters, max 100 characters
- **Organization number**: Required, format: XX-XXXXXXXX (regex: /^\d{2}-\d{8}$/)
- **Country**: Required, select from predefined list
- **NACE code**: Required, format: XX.XX (regex: /^\d{2}\.\d{2}$/)
- **Industry**: Required, select from predefined list
- **Revenue**: Required, number, min: 0, max: 999999999999
- **Balance sheet value**: Required, number, min: 0, max: 999999999999
- **Number of employees**: Required, integer, min: 1, max: 999999
- **Contact person name**: Required, min 2 characters, max 100 characters
- **Contact person email**: Required, valid email format
```

---

### 4. **Select Field Options Missing**

**Issue:** Country and Industry select fields don't have their options specified.

**Action Required:**
Add to Dev Notes:

```markdown
### Select Field Options

**Country Options:**
- Norway
- Sweden  
- Denmark
- Finland
- Iceland
- Germany
- United Kingdom
- Netherlands
- France
- Other

**Industry Options:**
- Manufacturing
- Services
- Retail
- Technology
- Healthcare
- Finance
- Construction
- Transportation
- Energy
- Agriculture
- Other
```

---

## üü° SHOULD-FIX ISSUES (Important Improvements)

### 5. **Single Step Navigation Behavior**

**Issue:** Unclear what happens when user clicks "Next" since this is only Step 1.

**Action Required:**
Add to Acceptance Criteria:
```
11. "Next" button is disabled/hidden since this is a single-step implementation
12. Form displays "Save Draft" and "Complete Step 1" buttons instead of standard navigation
```

---

### 6. **localStorage Key Inconsistency**

**Issue:** Story uses `form-general-info-step1` but parent story 4.1.10 used `form-general-info`.

**Action Required:**
Either:
- Change to `form-general-info-step1` consistently, OR
- Document why the key differs from parent story pattern

**Recommendation:** Use `form-general-info-step1` to avoid conflicts.

---

### 7. **Test Scenarios Specification**

**Issue:** TDD mentioned but specific test cases not detailed.

**Action Required:**
Add to Testing section:

```markdown
### Required Test Scenarios

1. **Field Rendering Tests:**
   - All 10 fields render correctly
   - Field labels match specifications
   - Required field indicators present

2. **Validation Tests:**
   - Each field validates according to rules
   - Form prevents submission with invalid data
   - Error messages display correctly

3. **Persistence Tests:**
   - Data saves to localStorage on change
   - Data restores on page reload
   - localStorage key is correct

4. **Edge Case Tests:**
   - Empty form submission blocked
   - Partial data saves correctly
   - Special characters handled properly
```

---

## üü¢ OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS (Nice to Have)

### 8. **Add Example Configuration**

Would help developers understand expected structure:

```typescript
// Example configuration structure
const step1Config = {
  id: 'company-info',
  title: 'Company Information',
  fields: [
    {
      type: 'text',
      name: 'companyName',
      label: 'Company Name',
      required: true,
      validation: { min: 2, max: 100 }
    },
    // ... more fields
  ]
}
```

---

### 9. **Reference Test Page Components**

Add specific component references:
- Which exact components from `/test` page will be reused?
- Are there any custom components needed?

---

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### If Fixed:
- **Development time**: 3-4 hours as estimated
- **Risk level**: Low
- **Success probability**: High (90%+)

### If Not Fixed:
- **Development time**: 6-8 hours (includes discovery/clarification)
- **Risk level**: High (confusion, rework likely)
- **Success probability**: Medium (60%)

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST FOR PM

Before marking this story as "Ready for Development", ensure:

- [ ] All 10 fields are listed in AC#2
- [ ] File creation subtasks added to Task 2
- [ ] Validation rules specified for all fields
- [ ] Select field options provided
- [ ] Navigation behavior clarified for single step
- [ ] localStorage key decision made and documented
- [ ] Test scenarios outlined
- [ ] All file paths verified against project structure

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **Immediate (Today):**
   - Fix field list in AC#2
   - Add file creation subtasks
   - Specify validation rules

2. **Before Development (Tomorrow):**
   - Add select field options
   - Clarify navigation behavior
   - Document localStorage key decision

3. **Nice to Have (This Week):**
   - Add example configuration
   - Include test scenarios
   - Reference specific test components

---

## üìù NOTES

- Story has excellent TDD approach and incremental strategy
- Splitting from 4.1.10 was a good decision for risk mitigation
- Once these fixes are applied, story will be ready for smooth implementation
- Development team will appreciate the clarity and completeness

---

## ü§ù NEXT STEPS

1. PM reviews and applies fixes to Story 4.1.11
2. PM notifies PO when updates complete
3. PO re-validates story
4. Upon validation pass, story moves to "Approved" status
5. Development can begin
