# Multi-Step Form Restructuring - Scrum Master Handover

**Date:** 2025-08-22  
**From:** Development Team  
**To:** Scrum Master  
**Status:** Ready for Story Creation  

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

The multi-step form components require restructuring to align with the sequential nature of the form steps. Currently, components are organized by type rather than by step, which doesn't reflect the user experience flow.

**Current Structure Issues:**
- Sustainability initiatives components are separated from the main form
- No clear step-based organization
- Tests are not organized by step
- Import paths are not intuitive

**Proposed Solution:**
Restructure to organize components by step sequence with proper test organization.

## ðŸ“Š Current State Analysis

### Current Directory Structure:
```
/components/forms/
â”œâ”€â”€ multi-step/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ multi-step-form.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ sustainability/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ InitiativeForm.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ InitiativeManager.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ InitiativesTable.tsx
```

### Form Steps:
1. **Step 1**: Company Information (basic details)
2. **Step 2**: Business Model + Subsidiaries (conditional)
3. **Step 3**: Sustainability Initiatives (with its own components)
4. **Step 4**: Sustainability Practices (additional sustainability info)

## ðŸ“ˆ Benefits of Restructuring

### For Developers:
- Clear step-based organization makes it easier to locate related files
- All components, schemas, and tests for a step are colocated
- Import paths become more intuitive and logical
- Easier to understand the form flow by looking at the directory structure

### For Testing:
- Each step has its own dedicated test directory
- Step-specific tests are easier to find and run
- Better test organization improves maintainability
- Cross-step integration tests remain in the root test directory

### For Maintenance:
- Adding new steps follows a clear pattern
- Modifying existing steps is more straightforward
- Reduces cognitive load when working with form components
- Aligns code organization with user experience

- [ ] Root `__tests__` directory contains cross-step integration tests
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved after restructuring
- [ ] All existing tests pass after restructuring
- [ ] No broken import paths anywhere in the codebase

### Technical Requirements:
- [ ] Import paths updated throughout the codebase

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Creation
- [ ] Create new `steps/` directory with subdirectories for each step
- [ ] Set up proper `__tests__` directories for each step
- [ ] Create initial index files for new structure

### Phase 2: File Movement
- [ ] Move step-specific components to respective step directories
- [ ] Move schemas and fields to respective step directories
- [ ] Move existing test files to new test structure
- [ ] Update all import paths throughout the codebase

### Phase 3: Component Updates
- [ ] Update main multi-step form to use new step-based imports
- [ ] Update step configurations to reference new structure
- [ ] Update external references (page components, etc.)

### Phase 4: Verification
- [ ] Run type checking to ensure all imports are correct
- [ ] Run all tests to verify functionality
- [ ] Test form in browser to ensure it works correctly
- [ ] Verify build process succeeds

## ðŸ“ˆ Sprint Planning Recommendations

### Effort Estimation:
- **Story Points:** 5-8 points (depending on team experience)
- **Time Estimate:** 1-2 developer days
- **Complexity:** Medium (many files to move and update)

### Skill Requirements:
- **Required:** TypeScript, React, file system navigation
- **Nice to have:** Experience with large-scale refactoring

### Dependencies:
- No external dependencies
- Should be done when no other major changes are happening to form components

---

## ðŸš¨ Risk Assessment

### Low Risks:
- Potential for broken import paths if not updated correctly
- Risk of missing some test files during movement
- Possible issues with index file exports

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Systematic approach with thorough verification at each phase
- Use search tools to find all references before making changes
- Run tests frequently during the process
- Keep a mapping of old paths to new paths

### Rollback Plan:
- Changes can be easily rolled back using version control
- Git history will show all file movements
- No database or external API changes involved

---

## ðŸ’¼ Resource Requirements

### Developer Skills Needed:
- **Primary:** TypeScript, React, file organization
- **Secondary:** Testing frameworks (Vitest, React Testing Library)
- **Helpful:** Experience with refactoring large codebases

### Time Allocation Estimate:
- **Total Effort:** 1-2 developer days
- **Can be split:** Yes, multiple developers can work on different steps
- **Best approach:** Single developer for consistency, or pair programming

## ðŸ“Ž Additional Notes

This restructuring aligns with the project's Component Refactoring and Modularization Standard and the Multi-step Form Implementation Standards. It will make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand for new team members.
