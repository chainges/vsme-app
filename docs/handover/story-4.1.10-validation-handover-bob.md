**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**From:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**To:** Bob (Scrum Master)  
**Subject:** Story 4.1.10 Validation Results - Template Format Compliance Required

---

## üìã **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Story 4.1.10 "GeneralInfo Page Integration" has been validated using comprehensive validation methodology. The story has **EXCELLENT technical merit and implementation readiness** but is **BLOCKED** due to template format compliance issues.

**Status:** ‚ùå **NO-GO** - Template format compliance required  
**Implementation Readiness:** 8/10 *(High - blocked only by format issues)*  
**Confidence Level:** **HIGH** for successful implementation once template issues resolved  

**‚ö†Ô∏è KEY INSIGHT**: This is a **format issue, not a content issue** - the technical planning is outstanding.

---

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **BLOCKING ISSUES (Format Compliance)**

1. **Non-Standard Template Structure**
   - **Issue:** Story uses custom format instead of required `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` structure
   - **Current:** "User Story" section, "Requirements" categories  
   - **Required:** Standard "Story" and "Acceptance Criteria" sections per template

2. **Missing Standard Story Format**
   - **Issue:** Missing required "**As a** [role], **I want** [action], **so that** [benefit]" format
   - **Current:** Has user story content but not in template format
   - **Action:** Restructure to template-compliant story format

3. **Section Naming Issues**
   - **Current:** "User Story" ‚Üí Should be "Story"
   - **Current:** "Functional/Integration/Quality Requirements" ‚Üí Should be "Acceptance Criteria" (numbered list)

## üìã **SPECIFIC RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS FOR BOB**

### **Priority 1: Template Structure Alignment (BLOCKING)**

**Current Structure:**
```markdown
## User Story
**As a** sustainability reporting user,
**I want** the GeneralInfo page to use...

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. GeneralInfo page renders...
**Integration Requirements:**
6. Existing page layout...
**Quality Requirements:**
10. TypeScript compilation...
```

**Required Template Structure:**
```markdown
## Story
**As a** sustainability reporting user,  
**I want** the GeneralInfo page to use the new MultiStepForm system with proper configuration,  
**so that** I can efficiently complete the general information section of my sustainability report through a guided, validated, multi-step experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GeneralInfo page renders MultiStepForm with proper configuration for general information collection
2. Form configuration includes all required steps: Company Information, Strategy & Goals, and Business Context
3. Form fields map correctly to sustainability reporting requirements from architecture documentation
[... continue numbering through all 12 requirements]
```

### **Priority 2: Content Preservation (CRITICAL)**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: The existing content is EXCELLENT - just needs reformatting:

- **Preserve ALL Dev Notes content** - Outstanding technical analysis
- **Keep ALL task details** - Perfect implementation plan
- **Maintain ALL testing requirements** - Comprehensive testing strategy  
- **Retain ALL technical specifications** - Accurate and thorough

### **Priority 3: Template Compliance Details**

**Required Changes:**
1. **Section Renaming:**
   - "User Story" ‚Üí "Story"
   - Requirements categories ‚Üí Numbered "Acceptance Criteria"

2. **Placeholder Cleanup:**
   - Dev Agent Record: Replace "*This section will be populated...*" with appropriate draft content
   - QA Results: Replace "*Results from QA Agent...*" with "To be populated after implementation"

3. **Format Alignment:**
   - Convert requirement categories into sequential numbered list
   - Ensure story follows exact template persona/action/benefit structure

## üìä **VALIDATION SCORES**

| Aspect | Score | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Technical Merit** | 10/10 | ‚úÖ Excellent | Outstanding analysis and planning |
| **Implementation Readiness** | 9/10 | ‚úÖ Ready | All dependencies verified |
| **Template Compliance** | 3/10 | ‚ùå Blocked | Format issues only |
| **Anti-Hallucination** | 10/10 | ‚úÖ Perfect | All claims verified |
| **Task Organization** | 10/10 | ‚úÖ Excellent | Clear, actionable sequence |

**Overall Assessment:** High-quality story blocked only by template format compliance

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Template Restructuring (Est: 45 minutes)**
1. Convert "User Story" section to "Story" with proper template format
2. Restructure requirements into numbered "Acceptance Criteria" list
3. Preserve all excellent technical content during restructuring
4. Clean up template placeholders

### **Step 2: Content Verification (Est: 15 minutes)**
1. Ensure all 12 requirements are properly numbered in Acceptance Criteria
2. Verify Story section follows exact role/action/benefit format
3. Confirm all technical details preserved in Dev Notes
4. Validate task-to-AC mapping remains clear

### **Step 3: Re-validation (Est: 10 minutes)**
1. Request re-validation to confirm NO-GO ‚Üí GO status
2. Verify template compliance resolves all blocking issues
3. Clear story for development with high confidence

## üìÑ **STORY CONTEXT REMINDER**

**Epic:** 4.1 - Multistep Form System (Brownfield Enhancement)  
**Dependencies:** ‚úÖ Story 4.1.8 (MultiStepForm Controller), ‚úÖ Story 4.1.9 (Step Renderer)  
**Value:** Integrates MultiStepForm system into GeneralInfo page for sustainability reporting  
**Priority:** Normal - Part of established Epic 4.1 sequence  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours (well-scoped implementation)

**Technical Status:**
- **‚úÖ MultiStepForm infrastructure exists** and matches described capabilities
- **‚úÖ Current GeneralInfo page confirmed** with accurate layout analysis
- **‚úÖ Integration path validated** through actual codebase verification
- **‚úÖ All dependencies verified** - no technical blockers

- Story follows `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` structure exactly
- All outstanding technical content preserved  
- Template placeholders removed
- Story ready for high-confidence implementation

### **Follow-up:**
- Re-validation should result in GO status with 9/10+ implementation readiness
- Story should be immediately ready for development agent assignment
- Implementation confidence very high due to excellent technical foundation
