# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the development of a comprehensive, reusable multi-step form system using TanStack Forms and Zod validation. The system will replace the existing React Hook Form implementation with a more flexible, type-safe solution that can be easily configured for different use cases. The initial implementation will focus on a sustainability reporting form for the general information page, but the architecture will support any multi-step form configuration.

1. WHEN the user starts the form THEN the system SHALL display fields for organization name, organization number, NACE code, industry, revenue, number of employees, contact person name, and contact person's email
2. WHEN the user enters invalid data THEN the system SHALL display real-time validation errors with clear messaging using TanStack Forms validation
3. WHEN the user completes valid organization information THEN the system SHALL allow progression to the next step
4. WHEN the user returns to this step THEN the system SHALL preserve previously entered data
5. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use Zod schemas for consistent validation rules

### Requirement 3: Business Model and Subsidiary Management

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to describe our business model and manage subsidiary information, so that I can provide comprehensive details about our organizational structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user reaches step 2 THEN the system SHALL display a business model textarea field
2. WHEN the step 2 loads THEN the default value for subsidiaries SHALL be "No"
3. WHEN the user selects "Yes" for subsidiaries THEN the system SHALL display dynamic subsidiary input fields using TanStack Forms field arrays
4. WHEN the user adds a subsidiary THEN the system SHALL provide fields for name, organization number, and address
5. WHEN the user has multiple subsidiaries THEN the system SHALL allow adding and removing subsidiary entries dynamically
6. WHEN the user selects "No" for subsidiaries THEN the system SHALL hide subsidiary fields and clear any existing subsidiary data
7. WHEN subsidiary data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL prevent form progression with appropriate validation messages

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Sustainability Initiatives Management

**User Story:** As a sustainability coordinator, I want to select and configure relevant sustainability initiatives, so that I can report on our specific environmental and social programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user reaches step 3 THEN the system SHALL display a list of sustainability initiative categories with checkboxes for selection
2. WHEN the user selects an initiative category THEN the system SHALL reveal fields for description, goal, and responsible person using conditional field rendering
3. WHEN the user deselects an initiative THEN the system SHALL hide the related fields and clear the data
4. WHEN multiple initiatives are selected THEN the system SHALL manage each initiative's data independently using TanStack Forms field arrays
5. WHEN initiative data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL validate required fields before allowing form submission
6. WHEN the user submits the form THEN the system SHALL include only selected initiatives with complete data in the final submission

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Form Navigation and Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a form user, I want clear navigation and progress indication, so that I can understand my position in the form and navigate efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on any step THEN the system SHALL display current step number, total steps, and percentage completion
2. WHEN the user completes a step THEN the system SHALL update the progress indicator with visual confirmation
3. WHEN the user navigates backward THEN the system SHALL preserve all previously entered data using TanStack Forms state management
4. WHEN the user attempts to skip required fields THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation and highlight missing information
5. WHEN the user reaches the final step THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive review of all entered data
6. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations for better user experience

### Requirement 6: Accessibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the form to be fully accessible and provide clear feedback, so that I can complete the form regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support tab order and keyboard shortcuts for all interactive elements
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and announcements
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL announce errors to assistive technologies
4. WHEN dynamic content appears THEN the system SHALL notify screen readers of content changes
5. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide clear success confirmation accessible to all users
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL focus on the first error field for better accessibility

### Requirement 7: Data Persistence and Recovery

**User Story:** As a form user, I want my progress to be saved automatically, so that I don't lose my work if I need to leave and return later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user progresses through steps THEN the system SHALL save form data to local storage automatically
2. WHEN the user returns to the form THEN the system SHALL restore previously saved data and resume from the last completed step
3. WHEN the user completes the form THEN the system SHALL clear local storage data after successful submission WHEN persistant database storage is implemented
4. WHEN the user explicitly resets the form THEN the system SHALL clear all saved data and return to the initial state
5. WHEN data persistence occurs THEN the system SHALL handle serialization of complex form data including arrays and nested objects

### Requirement 8: Form Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a form user, I want comprehensive validation and clear error messages, so that I can understand and correct any issues with my input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters invalid data THEN the system SHALL display field-level validation errors immediately using TanStack Forms real-time validation
2. WHEN the user attempts to proceed with invalid data THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation and highlight all errors
3. WHEN validation errors exist THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages defined in Zod schemas
4. WHEN the user corrects errors THEN the system SHALL remove error messages in real-time
5. WHEN async validation is needed THEN the system SHALL support debounced async validation using TanStack Forms capabilities
6. WHEN form-level validation occurs THEN the system SHALL support cross-field validation rules

### Requirement 9: Responsive Design and Mobile Support
