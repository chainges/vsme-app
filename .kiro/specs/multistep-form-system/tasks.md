## Testing Strategy

Each task includes comprehensive testing requirements:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and form flows
3. **Validation Tests**: Test all Zod schemas and validation rules
4. **Accessibility Tests**: Automated accessibility testing with jest-axe
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user journey testing

## Success Criteria

- All form steps render correctly with proper validation
- Data persists to local storage and restores on page reload
- Form is fully accessible and keyboard navigable
- All validation rules work correctly with clear error messages
- Responsive design works on all device sizes
- TypeScript provides full type safety and intellisense
- Comprehensive test coverage with passing tests
- Performance is optimized for smooth user experience

## Notes

- Local storage data will NOT be cleared on form submission for testing purposes
- The sustainability initiatives will use the provided INITIATIVE_CATEGORIES and INITIATIVE_LABELS
- All components must follow TanStack Forms patterns for object and array handling
- MongoDB Atlas integration is planned for a future phase but interfaces should support it
