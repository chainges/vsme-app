# Testing Strategy Implementation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the implementation of a comprehensive testing strategy for VSME Guru, a SaaS sustainability reporting platform. The testing strategy will establish a robust Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach with multiple testing layers including unit tests, integration tests, component tests, and end-to-end tests. This implementation will ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability while supporting the project's emphasis on professional development practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Testing Infrastructure Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete testing infrastructure so that I can write and run tests efficiently across all layers of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the testing infrastructure is set up THEN Vitest SHALL be configured as the primary testing framework for unit and integration tests
2. WHEN component testing is needed THEN React Testing Library SHALL be available with proper configuration
3. WHEN API mocking is required THEN MSW (Mock Service Worker) SHALL be configured for frontend tests
4. WHEN end-to-end testing is needed THEN Playwright SHALL be configured with multi-browser support
5. WHEN tests are run THEN coverage reporting SHALL be available with configurable thresholds
6. WHEN testing utilities are needed THEN custom test utilities SHALL be available for common testing patterns

### Requirement 2: Unit Testing Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests so that individual functions and components are thoroughly tested in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions exist THEN they SHALL have corresponding unit tests with 100% coverage
2. WHEN React components are created THEN they SHALL have unit tests covering all props and states
3. WHEN API utilities are implemented THEN they SHALL have unit tests with mocked dependencies
4. WHEN validation schemas exist THEN they SHALL have comprehensive unit tests for all validation rules
5. WHEN custom hooks are created THEN they SHALL have unit tests covering all use cases
6. WHEN unit tests are run THEN they SHALL execute in under 10 seconds for the entire suite

### Requirement 3: Integration Testing Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests so that API endpoints and database operations are tested with real interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints exist THEN they SHALL have integration tests covering all HTTP methods and status codes
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL have integration tests with test database setup
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN integration tests SHALL mock authentication appropriately
4. WHEN external services are used THEN integration tests SHALL use appropriate mocking strategies
5. WHEN integration tests are run THEN they SHALL use isolated test environments
6. WHEN data validation occurs THEN integration tests SHALL verify proper error handling

### Requirement 4: Component Testing Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component tests so that React components are tested with realistic user interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components exist THEN they SHALL have component tests covering user interactions
2. WHEN forms are implemented THEN they SHALL have tests covering validation and submission
3. WHEN navigation components exist THEN they SHALL have tests covering routing behavior
4. WHEN state management is used THEN component tests SHALL verify state changes
5. WHEN accessibility features are implemented THEN component tests SHALL verify ARIA attributes
6. WHEN responsive design is used THEN component tests SHALL verify different viewport behaviors

### Requirement 5: End-to-End Testing Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work correctly in real browser environments so that complete user workflows are validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical user journeys exist THEN they SHALL have end-to-end tests covering the complete flow
2. WHEN authentication flows are implemented THEN they SHALL have E2E tests for sign-in/sign-out
3. WHEN dashboard functionality exists THEN it SHALL have E2E tests covering navigation and interactions
4. WHEN forms are submitted THEN E2E tests SHALL verify data persistence and user feedback
5. WHEN responsive design is implemented THEN E2E tests SHALL verify mobile and desktop experiences
6. WHEN E2E tests are run THEN they SHALL execute against multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Requirement 6: Test-Driven Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a TDD workflow so that tests are written before implementation and guide development decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are developed THEN tests SHALL be written before implementation
2. WHEN bugs are discovered THEN failing tests SHALL be written to reproduce the issue before fixing
3. WHEN refactoring occurs THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass without modification
4. WHEN code coverage drops below thresholds THEN the build SHALL fail with clear feedback
5. WHEN tests fail THEN developers SHALL receive clear error messages and debugging information
6. WHEN TDD is followed THEN code coverage SHALL maintain minimum thresholds (80% for unit tests)

### Requirement 7: Continuous Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing in CI/CD so that code quality is maintained across all contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN all test suites SHALL run automatically in CI
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the build SHALL fail and prevent deployment
3. WHEN pull requests are created THEN test results SHALL be visible in the PR
4. WHEN coverage decreases THEN the CI SHALL report coverage changes
5. WHEN E2E tests are run in CI THEN they SHALL use headless browsers for performance
6. WHEN test results are available THEN they SHALL be archived for historical analysis

### Requirement 8: Testing Documentation and Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear testing documentation so that I can write consistent, high-quality tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN developers SHALL have access to testing guidelines and best practices
2. WHEN test patterns are established THEN they SHALL be documented with examples
3. WHEN testing utilities are created THEN they SHALL have comprehensive documentation
4. WHEN new developers join THEN they SHALL have access to testing onboarding materials
5. WHEN testing standards change THEN documentation SHALL be updated accordingly
6. WHEN debugging tests THEN developers SHALL have access to troubleshooting guides

### Requirement 9: Performance and Quality Metrics

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want testing performance metrics so that I can ensure tests remain fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test suites are run THEN execution time SHALL be monitored and reported
2. WHEN test performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be generated for investigation
3. WHEN flaky tests are detected THEN they SHALL be identified and addressed promptly
4. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL meet established quality gates
5. WHEN test maintenance is needed THEN metrics SHALL guide prioritization decisions
6. WHEN testing ROI is evaluated THEN metrics SHALL demonstrate value and effectiveness
