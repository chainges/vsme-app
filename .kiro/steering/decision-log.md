# Architectural Decision Log

*Format: Each decision includes context, options considered, decision made, and reasoning*

## Decision Template

```markdown
## [Date] - [Decision Title]

**Context**: What situation led to this decision?

**Options Considered**:
1. Option A - pros/cons
2. Option B - pros/cons
3. Option C - pros/cons

**Decision**: What we chose and why

**Consequences**: What this means for future development

**Status**: Active | Superseded | Deprecated

## 2025-01-08 - Documentation Strategy

**Context**: Initial project setup had comprehensive documentation for features that don't exist yet, creating confusion about what's actually implemented.

**Options Considered**:
1. Keep comprehensive upfront documentation - provides complete guidance but may not match reality
2. Minimal documentation that grows with implementation - more accurate but less guidance initially
3. Hybrid approach with clear current state vs future patterns - balances accuracy with guidance

**Decision**: Implement reactive documentation that evolves with the codebase, focusing on current state accuracy.

**Consequences**: 
- Documentation will be more accurate but initially less comprehensive
- Need to establish update protocols for when features are implemented
- AI agents will have better context about what actually exists

**Status**: Active

## 2025-01-08 - Technology Stack Selection

**Context**: Project was initialized with Better-T-Stack template providing opinionated technology choices.

**Options Considered**:
1. Accept all template choices as-is
2. Evaluate and potentially replace some technologies
3. Document rationale for keeping current stack

**Decision**: Keep current stack (Next.js 15, React 19, Hono, Prisma, MongoDB, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui) as it provides a solid foundation.

**Consequences**:
- Consistent with template design decisions
- Well-integrated toolchain
- Good performance characteristics with Bun runtime
- Modern React patterns with latest features

**Status**: Active

## 2025-01-08 - Error Handling Architecture

**Context**: Needed to implement comprehensive error handling and loading states for the application.

**Options Considered**:
1. Basic try-catch with simple error messages - minimal effort but poor UX
2. React Error Boundaries only - good for component errors but limited scope
3. Comprehensive system with boundaries, loading states, and recovery - more complex but better UX

**Decision**: Implemented comprehensive error handling system with React Error Boundaries, global error pages, loading states, and recovery mechanisms.

**Consequences**: 
- Significantly improved user experience with graceful error handling
- Better developer experience with clear error information in development
- Production-ready error handling that follows Next.js 15 best practices
- Foundation for future features with consistent error patterns

**Status**: Active

## 2025-01-08 - Code Style Configuration

**Context**: Ultracite was enforcing semicolons, but team preferred no semicolons for cleaner syntax.

**Options Considered**:
1. Accept Ultracite defaults - less configuration but team dissatisfaction
2. Override semicolon setting - requires configuration but improves team experience
3. Switch to different formatter - major change with unknown implications

**Decision**: Override Ultracite's semicolon setting with `"semicolons": "asNeeded"` in Biome configuration.

**Consequences**:
- Team satisfaction with cleaner code style
- Maintains all other Ultracite benefits (strict linting, type safety)
- Semicolons only added where ASI would fail (safety preserved)
- Consistent with modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices

**Status**: Active

## 2025-01-08 - Loading State Strategy

**Context**: Needed consistent loading states across the application for better user experience.

**Options Considered**:
1. Individual loading states per component - inconsistent but simple
2. Global loading state - consistent but inflexible
3. Component library with multiple loading variants - more complex but flexible

**Decision**: Implemented component library with multiple loading variants (inline, page, button, skeleton).

**Consequences**:
- Consistent loading experience across the application
- Flexible system that adapts to different use cases
- Better perceived performance with skeleton loading
- Reusable components reduce development time

**Status**: Active

## Future Decisions

*This section will be populated as we make architectural decisions during development*

### Pending Decisions
- Database schema design approach
- Authentication strategy (Clerk integration planned)
- API structure and routing patterns
- State management patterns (TanStack Query configured)
- Testing strategy implementation (Vitest planned)

### Decision Criteria

When making architectural decisions, consider:
1. **Alignment with current stack**: Does it work well with our chosen technologies?
2. **Developer experience**: Does it improve or hinder development workflow?
3. **Performance impact**: What are the performance implications?
4. **Maintainability**: How does this affect long-term maintenance?
5. **Team knowledge**: Do we have expertise with this approach?
6. **Community support**: Is there good documentation and community around this choice?
7. **Error handling**: How does this integrate with our error handling system?
8. **Type safety**: Does this maintain our TypeScript-first approach?
