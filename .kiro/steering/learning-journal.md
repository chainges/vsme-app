## 2025-01-08 - Documentation Evolution Insight

**Context**: Created comprehensive steering documents for a project in early stages.

**Discovery**: Premature documentation creates several problems:
- AI agents get confused about what actually exists
- Documentation becomes stale quickly if not based on real implementation
- Theoretical patterns may not match what we actually build
- Creates cognitive overhead for developers

**Impact**: Need to shift from predictive to reactive documentation approach.

**Action Items**:
- Focus documentation on current state
- Update docs after implementing features, not before
- Use real code examples from actual implementation
- Establish clear update protocols

## 2025-01-08 - Error Handling Implementation Success

**Context**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and loading states system for the application.

**Discovery**: Building error handling infrastructure first creates a solid foundation:
- Error boundaries prevent cascading failures and improve debugging
- Consistent loading states significantly improve perceived performance
- Type-safe async hooks reduce boilerplate and prevent common mistakes
- Global error pages provide better user experience than browser defaults
- Proper error recovery mechanisms increase user confidence

**Impact**: The application now has production-ready error handling that follows Next.js 15 and React 19 best practices.

**Action Items**:
- Document established patterns for team consistency
- Use these patterns as foundation for future feature development
- Consider gradual adoption of React 19 Actions for form handling
- Maintain error handling conventions as codebase grows

## 2025-01-08 - Code Style Preferences Matter

**Context**: Discovered that Ultracite configuration was enforcing semicolons, which conflicted with team preference.

**Discovery**: Code style preferences have significant impact on developer experience:
- Semicolons vs no-semicolons is still a valid debate in 2024
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript works well with ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion)
- Team consistency is more important than following any particular standard
- Configuration tools should be customizable to team preferences

**Impact**: Successfully configured Biome to use "asNeeded" semicolons, improving team satisfaction.

**Action Items**:
- Document code style decisions in steering documents
- Ensure all team members understand the rationale
- Keep configuration flexible for future adjustments
- Regular review of code style preferences as team evolves
