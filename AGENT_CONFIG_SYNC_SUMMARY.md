# Agent Configuration Sync Summary

*Last Updated: January 8, 2025*

## Overview
This document summarizes the synchronization of AI agent configurations across Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf based on the current project state and steering documents. All configurations have been updated to reflect the actual implementation status and established patterns.

## Synchronization Status
- [x] Claude Code configuration updated (.claude/CLAUDE.md)
- [x] Cursor rules updated (.cursor/rules/*.mdc)
- [x] Windsurf rules updated (.windsurfrules)
- [x] Consistency verified across all agents

## Key Information Synchronized

### Project Context
- **VSME Guru**: Sustainability reporting platform for SME market (VSME EU standard and NSRS compliant)
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js 15.3.0, React 19, Hono 4.8.10, Prisma 6.13.0, MongoDB, TailwindCSS 4.1.11, shadcn/ui
- **Build System**: Turborepo monorepo with Bun v1.2.19+ runtime
- **Code Quality**: Biome + Ultracite configuration (no semicolons preference)

### Current Implementation Status
All agents now accurately reflect:
- [x] **Backend API foundation** with Hono server structure and health check route
- [x] **Database setup** with Prisma and Zod (schema ready for model definitions)
- [x] **Mock authentication context** for UI development with localStorage persistence
- [x] **Complete sidebar-07 implementation** with collapsible navigation
- [x] **Comprehensive error handling system** (boundaries, global pages, recovery mechanisms)
- [x] **Loading states system** (skeleton, inline, page, button loaders)
- [x] **Marketing page** with VSME Guru branding and Norwegian content
- [x] **Dashboard layout** with responsive sidebar and breadcrumb navigation
- [x] **Complete shadcn/ui integration** with accessibility features
- [x] **API client** with error handling, retry logic, and type safety

### Development Guidelines
- **AI Agent Server Testing**: Never start dev servers with executeBash (hangs execution)
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Use MCP tools (list_components, get_block, get_component_demo)
- **Documentation Evolution**: Update docs after implementation, not before
- **Error Handling**: Always wrap components with error boundaries
- **Loading States**: Implement for all async operations
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript, zero tolerance for `any` types
- **Accessibility**: Comprehensive a11y requirements enforced

### Established Best Practices
1. Always wrap components with error boundaries
2. Implement loading states for all async operations
3. Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and API responses
4. Follow Next.js App Router conventions for file organization
5. Code style: No semicolons (configured in Biome with "asNeeded")
6. Maintain comprehensive documentation for complex implementations

## Agent-Specific Adaptations

### Claude Code (.claude/CLAUDE.md)
- **Format**: Comprehensive markdown with detailed rules and examples
- **Focus**: Complete project context with all Ultracite rules included
- **Length**: Extended format suitable for Claude's context window
- **Special Features**: Complete error handling patterns and component examples

### Cursor (.cursor/rules/*.mdc)
- **Format**: Modular MDC files with YAML frontmatter
- **Focus**: Concise, actionable rules organized by domain
- **Files**: project-context.mdc, react-components.mdc, api-development.mdc, ultracite.mdc
- **Special Features**: Glob patterns for targeted rule application

### Windsurf (.windsurfrules)
- **Format**: Single comprehensive rules file
- **Focus**: Structured guidelines with clear sections
- **Length**: Balanced between comprehensive and concise
- **Special Features**: Implementation status and critical development rules

## Key Changes Made

### Content Updates
1. **Current State Accuracy**: Updated all implementation status to reflect actual completed work
2. **Component Inventory**: Added comprehensive list of implemented components
3. **Error Handling Patterns**: Documented established error boundary and loading state patterns
4. **API Integration**: Added details about type-safe API client with retry logic
5. **Authentication Context**: Clarified mock authentication system for development

### Consistency Improvements
1. **Technology Versions**: Synchronized all version numbers across agents
2. **Command References**: Standardized development commands and usage
3. **File Structure**: Aligned project structure documentation
4. **Best Practices**: Unified established patterns and conventions

### Agent-Specific Enhancements
1. **Claude**: Enhanced with complete Ultracite rules and detailed examples
2. **Cursor**: Improved modular structure with targeted glob patterns
3. **Windsurf**: Streamlined for clarity while maintaining comprehensiveness

## Verification Checklist
- [x] All agents reference the same technology stack and versions
- [x] Implementation status is consistent across all configurations
- [x] Development commands are standardized
- [x] Error handling patterns are documented consistently
- [x] shadcn/ui integration rules are aligned
- [x] AI agent server testing guidelines are included
- [x] Documentation evolution protocol is referenced
- [x] Established best practices are consistently stated

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor Consistency**: Ensure agents provide consistent guidance
2. **Update After Features**: Maintain synchronization as new features are implemented
3. **Gather Feedback**: Collect developer feedback on agent effectiveness
4. **Iterate**: Refine configurations based on real usage patterns

## Documentation References
- **Steering Documents**: `.kiro/steering/*.md` (source of truth)
- **Current State**: `.kiro/steering/current-state.md` (implementation status)
- **Error Handling**: `.kiro/steering/error-handling-conventions.md` (established patterns)
